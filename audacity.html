	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

	<p>This is a guide for the 3.0.3, 3.0.4, and 3.0.5 versions of Audacity, which is a free
	multi-track audio editor. You can use it for recording, simple editing
	of single tracks, or more advanced editing involving multiple tracks.</p>

	<p>Audacity 3.0.3 to 3.0.5 are the first versions of Audacity on Windows to be available
	as either a 64 bit or a 32 bit version. All the versions of Audacity on Windows before this
	were only available as 32 bit versions. It's recommended to install
	the 64 bit version, unless you have particular reasons for needing
	to install the 32 bit version.  Note that if you're going to install
	the 64 bit version, and you have a 32 bit version of Audacity installed,
	you should uninstall this before installing the 64 bit version.</p>

	<p>You can download the 64 bit version of Audacity 3.0.5 using the following link:
	<a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/releases/download/Audacity-3.0.5/audacity-win-3.0.5-64bit.exe">Audacity 3.0.5 64 bit installer</a>.
	and the 32 bit version using the following link:
	<a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/releases/download/Audacity-3.0.5/audacity-win-3.0.5-32bit.exe">Audacity 3.0.5 32 bit installer</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>The remaining sections of the introduction are as follows. There are introductions
	to Projects and the cursor in Audacity, and descriptions of some message boxes which
	can be shown at startup,
	and how to get help. There is then an outline of some new features and
	changes which were introduced in Audacity 3.0.3. There
	are then sections on Audacity's two sets of default shortcuts, some advice
	if you are using a non US/UK keyboard,
	and details of where to get the Jaws script for Audacity.</p>

		
	<h3>Projects</h3>
	
	<p>The objects which Audacity edits are known as projects. So projects
	are equivalent to documents in Microsoft Word, and workbooks in
	Microsoft Excel.</p>
	
	<p>An Audacity project simply consists of a number of tracks, and there
	are a number of different types of track in Audacity: audio, label,
	and time. However, time track are not accessible to users of screen readers,
	and so won't be described in this guide.
	For many simple tasks you'll probably only have one track in a project.</p>
	
	<p>You can save an Audacity project using the Audacity project
	file format, and this preserves all the tracks in the project.
	However, you only need to save a project in this format if you
	intend to continue working on the project in the future.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Cursor</h3>
	
	<p>Audacity has a cursor to specify a particular time during the
	audio, and this is similar to the cursor in Microsoft Word. The
	cursor in Audacity is used for defining times such as: the start
	of playback, the position where you want to start selecting a time range,
	and the place where audio is pasted from the clipboard.</p>


	<h3>Messages boxes which may be shown after opening Audacity.</h3>

	<p>One or more of the messages boxes described in the next three sections
	may be shown when you open Audacity.</p>

	<h4>App updates</h4>

	<p>If you haven't previously used a version of Audacity which has
	the option of automatically checking for updates, then when you first
	open Audacity, an App updates message box
	opens which tells you about this feature.
	By default Audacity now periodically checks to see whether there
	is a new version available. If you
	don't want this checking to happen, then there's a link in the
	dialog to the application category in the Preferences dialog
	where you can change the setting. You can also change this setting
	at any time, as described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#automatic-checking-for-updates">Automatic checking for
	updates section</a> of the Preferences section</p>
	
		
	<h4>Welcome to Audacity!</h4>
	
	<p>When you open Audacity, a Welcome message box opens, and this
	contains an HTML window which contains some information on how to
	obtain help for Audacity. Unfortunately the links in this text
	can't be opened using keyboard navigation, but details of the
	available help are given in the next section. The message box
	also contains a Don't show this again at start up check box.
	To stop the message box appearing in future, just check the check box,
	and press the OK button.</p>


	<h4>FFmpeg startup failed</h4>

	<p>If you install the 64 bit version of Audacity 3.0.3, 3.0.4, or 3.0.5
	and have previously only installed the FFmpeg library for 32 bit versions
	of Audacity, then the first time you open Audacity,
	a FFmpeg startup failed dialog will open, telling you that there's a problem.
	This can easily be fixed by installing the 64 bit version of the FFmpeg
	library, as described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#ffmpeg-library">FFmpeg library section</a> of the Preferences
	section.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Help</h3>
	
	<p>Audacity is an extremely powerful program, and this is only
	an introductory guide. For more information see:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The installed Audacity user manual which can be opened in your
		default browser by choosing Manual on the Help menu.</li>

		<li><a href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Audacity_Wiki_Home_Page">The Audacity Wiki</a>.</li>

		<li>The <a href="https://www.freelists.org/list/audacity4blind">Audacity4Blind mailing list</a>.
		There are a couple of ways you can request to be subscribed to this list.
		The first is using this web page: type your
		email address into to the your email address edit box;
		then <strong>Tab</strong> to and check the check box to indicate that you
		aren't a robot; and finally <strong>Tab</strong> to the Next button and press it.
		The second way is to send an email to ecartis@freelists.org, with the
		subject subscribe Audacity4Blind.
		After making your request by either method, you will receive an email to
		confirm your subscription. In that email, open the
		link to confirm your email address. A web page opens in which you have to
		agree to various terms. There are three check boxes which have to be checked,
		and finally a Next button to press.</li>	
	</ul>


	<h3>New features and changes</h3>

	<p>The new features and changes which were introduced in Audacity 3.0.3 include
	the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Audacity is available in both 64 bit and 32 bit versions, as already
		described above.</li>

		<li>Automatic checking for updates. This feature is enabled by default, but
		can be switched on or off at any time as described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#automatic-checking-for-updates">Automatic checking for
		updates section</a> of the Preferences section
		</li>

		<li>Error and crash reporting. When an error or crash occurs, there is now
		the option to send a report. A dialog informing you of the error or the
		crash, gives the option of either sending or not sending this information.
		</li>

		<li>Privacy policy. Both the automatic checking for updates and sending
		error and crash reports involves sending information to the company which
		now controls Audacity. Because of this there's a privacy policy, which
		lets you know about what information is sent, and how it's used. Here's a link
		to the privacy policy on Audacity's website:
		<a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/about/desktop-privacy-notice/">Privacy policy</a>.
		There are also links to this policy in appropriate places in the
		program itself.</li>
	</ul>
	

	
	<h3>Default shortcuts</h3>

	<p>If you run Audacity 2.2.0 or later in a user account where versions of Audacity
	before 2.2.0 have not been run, then by default, there are less shortcuts available than
	in those earlier versions of the program. However, you can change to using a fuller set
	of shortcuts, and this is described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#standard-and-full">Standard and full sets of default shortcuts section</a>
	of the Preferences section. The remainder of this guide assumes you are using
	the full set.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Using keyboards other than US, UK, or Irish</h3>
	
	<p>If you're using a keyboard other than a US, UK, or Irish keyboard, then a couple
	of important keystrokes won't work if you're using Audacity's default settings.
	To fix this, see the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#the-and-shortcuts">The left and right bracket shortcuts on keyboards
	other than US, UK or Irish section</a>, which is in the Customizing section.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Jaws Script</h3>
	
	<p>There's a Jaws script for Audacity, and its uses include giving additional feedback, and providing
	convenient ways of obtaining information. Full details of its functionality can be found on the
	<a href="https://github.com/campg2j003/JAWS-Script-for-Audacity">Jaws Script for Audacity website</a>.
	A direct link to the installer for a beta version of version 2.2.2 of this script is:
	<a href="https://github.com/campg2j003/JAWS-Script-for-Audacity/releases/download/rel2.2.2-beta-2020-06-21/Jaws-Script-for-Audacity_2_2_2-beta-2020-06-21.exe">Jaws-Script-for-Audacity_2_2_2-beta-2020-06-21.exe</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Note that for those using Jaws, the remainder of the guide does not assume that this
	script is installed.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2 id="main-window">Main window</h2>
	
	<h3>Main components</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Title bar. When the window contains an unnamed project,
		for example, when you first start Audacity, then the text in the title bar
		is Audacity. When the window contains a named project,
		then the text is the name of the project.</li>
		
		<li>Menu bar. There is an <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#extra-menu">extra menu</a>
		which can be shown in the menu bar, but which are not shown by default.</li>
		
		<li><a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#upper-toolbars">Upper toolbars</a>.</li>
		
		<li><a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#track-table">Track view table</a>.
		This contains the tracks which make up the project.</li>
		
		<li><a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#lower-toolbars">Lower toolbars</a>.</li>
		
		<li>Status bar, which is divided into 3 sections. The first section
		is probably of the most interest, and contains the transport status,
		that is, whether Audacity is stopped, playing, recording and so on.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>Moving around the window</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>As in any window, to move to the menu bar press <strong>Alt</strong>,
		and to leave it press <strong>Esc</strong> of <strong>Alt</strong>.</li>

		<li>Pressing <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> cycles you around the following
		components: Upper toolbars, Track view table, and Lower toolbars.
		Pressing <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F6</strong> cycles you around in the
		opposite direction.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Reading the status bar</h3>

	<p>If you're using Jaws or NVDA, you can read Audacity's
	status bar using the screen reader's standard keystroke for reading a status
	bar. Unfortunately, Narrator doesn't currently have a command to read the status bar.
	However if the track view
	is the focus, then you can move to the first field of the status bar by
	pressing <strong>Narrator key + Right arrow</strong>, and return to the
	track view by pressing <strong>Narrator key + Left arrow</strong>.</p>

	
	
	<h2 id="opening-audio-file">Opening an audio file</h2>
	
	<p>To open either an audacity project file or a standard audio file,
	use the Open dialog, which is on the File menu (<strong>Ctrl + O</strong>).
	The dialog's title is Select one or more audio files...,
	and its structure is similar to the standard Windows XP Open dialog.
	The types of standard audio files which Audacity can open described
	in the next section.</p>
	
	<p>When you first open Audacity, the window contains an empty
	track view table, and so when you open an audio file, it opens in
	this initial window. After opening a standard audio file,
	the track view table contains a single track, whereas after opening an Audacity
	project file, the track view table contains all the tracks in the saved project.
	If you then open any other audio files, then they
	each open in a new window. (If you want to deliberately create
	a new window with an empty project, choose New from the File menu,
	or press <strong>Ctrl + N</strong>.)</p>
	
	<p>In addition to opening standard audio files, you can also import one or
	more standard audio files into the current project. In this case, a new
	track is added to the track view table for each of the files. For details,
	see the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#importing-audio-files">Importing audio files section</a>.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Opening standard audio files</h3>
	
    <p>The default installation of Audacity can open audio files in the following standard
    formats: WAV, AIFF, AU, MP3, MP2/MPEG, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC.
	In addition, you can open files in some other formats, including
	wma and m4a if you download and install the FFmpeg library,
	as described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#ffmpeg-library">FFmpeg library section</a>. This is not included in the
	installation of Audacity due to legal issues about patents.</p>

	
	<h2 id="saving-audio">Saving audio</h2>
	
	<p>You can save the audio in a project in either the audacity project
	format, or one of the standard audio formats, as described in the following sections.
	The Audacity project format preserves all the tracks in the project.
	You only need to save a project in the audacity project format
	if you intend to continue working on the project in the future.
	In contrast, when you save in one of the standard audio formats,
	Audacity automatically mixes all the tracks down to a single track.</p>
	
	<p>When you close Audacity, if you haven't saved your changes to
	an Audacity project file, then a Save changes? dialog opens asking
	you whether you want to save changes before closing. The default
	button is Yes, but unless you want to save the project as an
	Audacity project file, just <strong>Tab</strong> to the NO button
	and press it.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Saving audio in the audacity project format</h3>
	
	<p>To save in this format, open the File menu, open the Save Project
	sub menu, and choose Save Project (<strong>Ctrl + S</strong>). The first
	time you do this, you get a Warning dialog box telling you that
	only Audacity can read these project files. The dialog box contains
	a check box which you can check if you don't want this warning again.
	If you press the OK button, you then get a Save Project As dialog.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Saving audio in one of the standard audio formats</h3>
	
	<p>The default installation of Audacity can save in the following
	standard formats: WAV, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and MP2. In addition,
	you can save in some other formats, such as wma and m4a,
	if you download and install the FFmpeg library, which is not included
	with Audacity because of legal issues with patents. Details of
	how to do this are given in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#ffmpeg-library">FFmpeg library section</a>.</p>
		
	<p>To save audio in one of the standard audio formats:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>To save all the audio, open the File menu, open the Export
        sub menu, and choose Export Audio (<strong>Ctrl + Shift + E</strong>).
		Alternatively, to save only the selected audio, choose Export Selected
		Audio from the same sub menu.</li>	
		
		<li>The Export Audio dialog opens, and its structure is very
		similar to a standard Windows XP Save As dialog. The folder where
		the file will be saved is shown in the Save in combo box
		(<strong>Alt + I</strong>). When the dialog opens this folder is
		set to the folder which you used last time you exported audio.
		If it's the first time, then the folder is an Audacity folder
		in your documents folder, which is automatically created for
		you by Audacity. If necessary change the folder where the
		file will be saved.</li>
		
		<li>To set the file format which you want to use for saving
		the audio, there's a Save as type combo box, which is the next
		control after the File name edit box.
		Note that all the formats which use the FFmpeg library, have
		FFmpeg in parenthesis after their name.</li>
		
		<li>Optionally, after choosing the file format, you can set the options for
		the encoding used by that format by tabbing to the controls which
		appear after the Cancel button.</li>

		<li>In the File name edit box type a name for the file, and then
		press the Save button (<strong>Alt + S</strong>). An Edit Metadata tags
		dialog opens.</li>
		
		<li>This dialog enables you to edit
		various items of information about the audio data, such as the
		Artist name, and the Track title, and is described in detail in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#metadata-tags-editor">Metadata tags editor section</a> later in the guide.
		If you don't want to edit any of the information, then you
		can just press <strong>Enter</strong> to press the default OK button.
		Note that if you cancel the dialog,
		as well as cancelling any edits in this dialog, this also cancels the saving
		of the audio. If you don't want the Edit Metadata tags dialog to automatically
		open each time you save audio, then you can turn this option
		off, as described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#edit-metadata-tags-dialog-opens-during-export">Edit Metadata Tags dialog opens during export section</a>,
		which is in the Preferences section.</li>
		
		<li>Note that if you've tried to save
		in any of the formats included in the FFmpeg library, then a message
		box opens telling you that it needs to be configured.</li>			
	</ol>
	
	<p>The Export (or the Save Other) sub menu on the File menu also contains commands for opening dialogs for
	Exporting as MP3, Wav, and OGG. These commands open the Export Audio dialog with the
	Save as type combo box already set to the appropriate format. However, given that the Export
	Audio dialog remembers the last format that was used, and that the more specific commands
	do not have default shortcuts, you may find is more convenient just to use the Export Audio
	dialog.</p>

	
	
	<h2 id="playback">Playback</h2>

	<h3>Playback settings</h3>

	<p>You can select the playback device which Audacity uses in a number of places,
	including the Upper toolbars section of Audacity's main window and the Devices
	category of the Preferences dialog. If you only have one playback device on your
	computer, you shouldn't need to change the setting.</p>

	<p>The volume of the playback is controlled by playback volume slider which is
	in the Upper toolbars section of Audacity's main window.</p>

	<p>To change either of these settings in the Upper toolbars section of the main window,
	assuming that the Track view is the current focus:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> twice to move to the Upper toolbars section</li>

		<li><strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Shift + Tab</strong> until you get to
		either the Playback device combo box or the Playback volume slider and
		make any changes you want.</li>

		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to return to the Track view.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Playback depends on whether there is a time range selected
	(see the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#selecting-audio">Selecting audio section</a>):
	if there is no selection, then playback starts at the cursor position;
	if there is a selection, then playback starts at the start of the selection,
	and stops at the end of the selection.</p>


	<h3>Playback commands and keystrokes</h3>

	<p>These are the keystrokes for some common playback commands. Apart from the
	commands for seeking, the commands can be found in the Playing sub menu
	of the Transport menu:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To start or stop, press <strong>Spacebar</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To start or stop and move the cursor, press <strong>X</strong>.
		When you use this keystroke to stop playback, the cursor is moved to
		position where the playback was stopped.</li>
	
		<li>Pause or resume, press <strong>P</strong>.</li>
	
		<li>Seeking/Jumping. Whilst playing, if the focus is in the Track
		view table, you can jump forward or backward
		by either a short or long period. To jump backward or forward by
		a short period press <strong>Left Arrow</strong> or
		<strong>Right Arrow</strong> respectively. To jump backward or forward
		by a long period, press <strong>Shift + Left Arrow</strong> or
		<strong>Shift + Right Arrow</strong> respectively. The default sizes
		of the short and long periods are 1 and 15 seconds respectively,
		but their sizes can be set in the Preferences dialog,
		as described in the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#seek-times">Seek times section</a>.</li>
		
		<li>To play looped, that is to continuously repeat, press
		<strong>Shift + Spacebar</strong>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For all the commands listed above which start playback,
	where playback starts and and then automatically stops depends on whether a time
	range is selected (see the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#selecting-audio">Selecting audio section</a>).
	If there is no selection, then playback starts at the cursor position,
	and automatically stops at the end of the audio in the project. If a time
	range is selected, then playback starts at the start of this selection,
	and automatically stops at the end of the selection.</p>
	
	<p>If you ever need to check the playback status, that is, playing, stopped or paused,
	then this information is available as the  first item in the status bar.</p>

	<p>Audacity includes several more specialized playback commands, and these
	are described in the appropriate places in the guide. A full list of
	playback commands is available in the Playback section of the Keystrokes
	section.</p>



	<h2 id="track-table">Track view table</h2>
	
	<p>The Track view table contains the tracks which make up the project.
	The table just has one column, and a row for each of the tracks.
	Each track has a name, and your screen reader reads this when you move to the
	track, or press your screen reader's keystroke to read the
	current line.</p>
	
	<p>An audio track is a container for audio data, and this is
	displayed as a waveform. Often the audio data starts at time zero,
	but after editing, this is not always the case. At the left hand end
	of an audio track there is a small area containing various controls,
	which include a menu, and controls
	for track gain and pan. Using these controls is described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#editing-multiple-tracks">Editing when there are multiple tracks section</a> of this guide.</p>
	
	<p>The Cursor is displayed in the track view table as a vertical line,
	as is the playback position during playback. The positions of
	both the cursor and the playback position are available to screen reader users
	via the Start of selection and Audio Position spin boxes in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#selection-toolbar">Selection Toolbar</a>.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Track focus</h3>
	
	<p>Whenever the focus is within the track view table, and the table
	contains one or more tracks (rows), then one of the tracks has
	the focus, and you can move to the next or previous track by pressing
	<strong>Down Arrow</strong> or <strong>Up Arrow</strong>, respectively.
	You can also move to the first or last track by pressing
	<strong>Ctrl + Home</strong> or <strong>Ctrl + End</strong>, respectively.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="track-selection">Track selection</h3>
	
	<p>You need to be able to select tracks:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>For operations such as aligning tracks which can be found
		on the Tracks menu.</li>
		
		<li>As part of the process of selecting some audio, as described
		in the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#selecting-audio">Selecting audio section</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>There are a number of ways of selecting and deselecting tracks:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To toggle the selection of the focused track, press
		<strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To select all the tracks (and a time range which includes all the
		audio, as described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#selecting-audio">Selecting audio section</a>), open the
		Select menu and choose All (<strong>Ctrl + A</strong>)</li>
		
		<li>To deselect all the tracks (and any time-range), open the
		Select menu and choose None (<strong>Ctrl + Shift + A</strong>).</li>
		
		<li>To select all the tracks, open the Select menu, open the Tracks sub menu,
		and choose In all tracks (<strong>Ctrl + Shift + K</strong>).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If a track is selected, then when your screen reader reads the name of a track, it
	also says selected.</p>


	<h2 id="toolbars">Toolbars</h2>


	<p>There are two sections of the main window which contain toolbars, and these will
	be referred to as the upper and lower toolbar sections. The upper toolbars section
	appears above the track view table, and the lower toolbars section appears below it.
	As previously mentioned you can cycle round the upper toolbars, the track view table,
	and the lower toolbars either forwards or backwards by pressing <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> or
	<strong>Ctrl + Shift + F6</strong> respectively.</p>

	<p>In both the upper and lower toolbars sections, you can navigate to all the controls in
	the toolbars in that section by pressing <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Shift + Tab</strong>.
	Note that you can only press the buttons in the toolbars by pressing
	<strong>Enter</strong>. You can't use <strong>Spacebar</strong>, as this key
	is the keystroke for starting and stopping playback.</p>

	<p>You can show and hide all these toolbars using the Toolbars sub-menu
	on the View Menu. Only showing the toolbars which you find useful has the advantage
	of greatly reducing the number of <strong>Tab</strong>s needed to find a particular control.</p>

	<p><strong>Bug warning</strong>: There's a bug which affects users who have
	been using Audacity since version 2.2.1 or earlier. You may find that if
	you show a toolbar which has not been shown since version 2.2.1, then
	the toolbar will be shown as a floating toolbar
	somewhere in the Audacity window, and you will not be able to tab to it.
	To work around this, choose reset toolbars on the Toolbars sub menu.
	You can then set which toolbars are displayed.</p>

	<p>The remainder of this section on toolbars contains sections on the
	upper and lower toolbars, and then sections on some individual toolbars:
	the selection, time, and play at speed toolbars.</p>


	<h3 id="upper-toolbars">Upper toolbars</h3>
	
	<p>By default, the Upper toolbars section of the main window contains
	the following toolbars:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Transport. This contains buttons for playback and recording,
		and all the commands are also available on the Transport
		menu, and have keyboard shortcuts.</li>
		
		<li>Tools. This contains tool buttons for editing which involve the
		use of the mouse.</li>
		
		<li>Recording meter and Playback meter. Each of these contains a drop down
		button which opens a menu for controlling the meter.</li>
		
		<li>Mixer. This contains the recording and playback volume sliders.</li>
		
		<li>Edit. This contains buttons for Cut, Paste, etc. These
		commands are also available on either the Edit or View menu,
		and all have keyboard shortcuts.</li>
		
		<li><a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#play-at-speed-toolbar">Play at speed</a>, which contains
		a play at selected speed button and a playback speed slider.</li>
		
		<li>Device. This contains combo boxes for Audio host, the
		recording device, the number of recording channels, and the playback device. Note that
		if one of these combo boxes is the focus, and you press a character key which
		is an Audacity shortcut, then the key is used for the shortcut, rather
		than selecting an option beginning with that character. So selecting
		an option using its first character is not recommended. All of these settings
		can also be made either in individual dialogs, or in the Devices category
		of the Preferences dialog, as described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#recording-settings">Recording settings section</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> The Upper toolbars section also contains a Timeline options
	button, which opens a menu containing items which either aren't of
	much interest to most screen reader users, or which duplicate
	settings which can be more conveniently available elsewhere.</p>
	

	<h3 id="lower-toolbars">Lower toolbars</h3>

	<p>By default, the Lower toolbars section of the main window contains the
	selection toolbar and the time toolbar, and these toolbars are described
	in the following two sections.</p>
		
	
	<h3 id="selection-toolbar">Selection toolbar</h3>

	<p>The selection toolbar contains the following controls:</p>

	<ul>	
		<li>Project Rate edit-combo box. This is the sampling rate of the project.</li>
		
		<li>Snap To combo box, which is described below.</li>
			
		<li>A Show combo box which determines which details of any selected time
		range are shown in the two edit spin boxes, which are the next two controls
		in the toolbar.
		The options for the details which are shown are: start and end, start and length,
		length and end, and length and center.</li>
		
		<li>Two edit spin boxes, which give the details of the selected time range,
		which have been specified by the preceding combo box.
		If there is no time range selected, then the start, end, or center edit spin
		boxes give the position of the cursor.</li>	
	</ul>		

	
	<h4 id="edit-spin-boxes">Edit spin boxes</h4>

	<p>The controls on the selection toolbar which are used for displaying and changing
	times are often referred to as edit spin boxes. They have this name because
	to change a time you can either type in times, or use <strong>Up Arrow</strong>
	or <strong>Down Arrow</strong> to increase or decrease the value of the time
	respectively. In the guide they will often be referred to as just spin boxes for brevity.</p>

	<p>Each spin boxes contains a time which can be in a number of different
	formats, and you can change it by choosing one of the options on a
	spin box's context menu. In the case of the edit spin boxes in the Selection toolbar,
	if you change the format of one of them, then this change is also applied to
	the other one. The default format of the edit spin boxes in the Selection toolbar
	is hh:mm:ss + milliseconds, but the format hh:mm:ss + hundredths is
	a useful alternative, as adjusting times to a hundredth of a millisecond is normally
	accurate enough. Nearly all the examples in this guide will use the latter format.</p>
	
	<p>The time can be considered to be made up of one or more
	sections, depending on the format used. For example, when using the hh:mm:ss
	+ hundredths format, the time consists of four sections: hours, minutes, seconds,
	and centi-seconds (hundredths of seconds), each consisting of two digits.</p>

	<p>If you move to a spin box by tabbing, then your screen reader reads the entire
	contents of the spin box, for example, 00h13m04.73s, that is 0 hours, 13 minutes, and
	4.73 seconds.</p>

	<p>Within a spin box, one of the digits is the focus. When you first
	move to a spin box after opening Audacity, the last digit is the
	focus, but if you subsequently return to the spin box, then the digit
	which was the focus when you left the spin box is the focus.
	The keystrokes for moving the focus are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Home</strong> or <strong>End</strong> move you to
		the first or last digit in the spin box respectively.</li>

		<li><strong>Left Arrow</strong> or <strong>Right Arrow</strong>
		cycle you through the digits to the left or right respectively.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When you use one of these keystrokes, your screen reader reads the digit which
	is now the focus. In addition, if you've moved to a different
	section of the time, then your screen reader reads the new section before reading
	the digit. For example, if the time is 01h42m38.46s and the focus
	is the second of the minutes digits (the digit 2), then if you press
	<strong>Right arrow</strong> your screen reader says 38s, 3. Alternatively, if you
	press <strong>End</strong> then your screen reader says 46 centi-seconds, 6.</p>

	<p>There are a couple of ways of changing the value of the time:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Increasing or decreasing the value of the control by one unit
		of the focussed digit using
		<strong>Up Arrow</strong> or <strong>Down Arrow</strong>. This way is
		useful for increasing or decreasing the value by a given amount of
		time. After each of these keystrokes, your screen reader says the value of the current
		section. For example, if you want to
		increase the time by 3 tenths of a second, and
		assuming that the format is set to hh:mm:ss + hundredths: press <strong>End</strong>
		to move to the last digit, press <strong>Left arrow</strong>
		to move to the tenths of a second digit, and press <strong>Up Arrow</strong>
		three times.</li>
		
		<li>Typing in digits. This way is useful for setting a time which not
		connected to the current value. If you type a digit (0 to 9), then the value of the
		focussed digit is replaced by this, and the next digit becomes the focus,
		and your screen reader reads the digit which is now the focus.
		If the last digit is the initial focus, then after you type a digit,
		then the first digit is the focus. For example, if you want to set a control
		to 32 minutes, and again assuming the control has the hh:mm::ss + hundredths
		format: press <strong>Home</strong> to move to the first
		digit, and then type the following 8 digits: 0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0. This
		completely replaces the existing time with the time of 32 minutes.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you are using the Jaws screen reader, you can always read the entire time by pressing the
	keystroke to read the current line.</p>
	
		
	<h4 id="snap-to-combo-box">Snap To combo box</h4>
	
	<p>The Snap to combo box contains three options: Off, which is the default, Nearest,
	and Prior. If the combo box is set to either Nearest or Prior, then this has two effects on
	using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor or the start or end of a selected time range.</p>
	
	<p>The first effect is that if Snap combo box to is set to Nearest, then if you move the cursor
	or the start or end of a selected time range, then its position is always automatically adjusted to the
	nearest whole number of the smallest unit in the format of the edit spin boxes. For example,
	if format is hh:mm:ss, then a position of 1.3 seconds would be adjusted to 1 second,
	and a time of 1.8 seconds would be adjusted to 2 seconds. In a similar manner,
	if the Snap to combo box is set to Prior, then the times 1.3 seconds and 1.8 seconds
	would both be adjusted to 1 second.</p>
	
	<p>If the Snap to combo box is set to Nearest or Prior, the second effect is that
	the minimum amount that the position of the cursor or the start or end of selection
	changes by is the smallest unit in the format of the edit spin boxes. So, for
	example, if the format is set to hh:mm:ss, and you press <strong>Right arrow</strong>
	to move the cursor to the right, the minimum change in position is 1 second.</p>


	<h3 id="time-toolbar">Time toolbar</h3>

	<p>The Time toolbar is in the Lower toolbars section of the main window, and contains
	a single control, an audio position spin box. During playback or recording, this
	shows the position of the playback recording cursor respectively. Otherwise,
	it shows the time that playback would start if you pressed <strong>Spacebar</strong>.
	Note that unlike the spin boxes in the Selection toolbar, you can't change the
	time shown by the audio position spin box, you can only read its value.</p>

	<p>The default format of the audio position spin box is hh:mm:ss. You can
	change this using the control's context menu, but unfortunately there is bug
	which causes the format to be reset to the default value if you open the
	Preferences dialog and press the OK button.</p>


	<h3 id="play-at-speed-toolbar">Play at speed toolbar</h3>

	<p>The play at speed toolbar is in the upper toolbars section of the main window,
	and enables you to playback audio at speeds varying from
	very slow to three times the normal playback speed. It contains:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A Play at selected speed button. Note that as with all buttons in the toolbars,
		you can only press the button with <strong>Enter</strong>, as <strong>Spacebar</strong>
		is the shortcut for Play at normal speed, and stop.</li>

		<li>A Playback speed slider, with values up to 300, which corresponds to 3 times
		the normal playback speed.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There's an option for play at speed which makes some important differences. In the
	Preferences dialog, in the Playback category, in the Options group,
	there's a Vari-Speed Play check box, which is checked by default.
	The effects of this setting are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If checked, then when you change the value of the playback speed slider during
		play at speed, it has immediate effect. However, during playback, the seek commands
		described above have no effect.</li>

		<li>If not checked, then changes to the value of the playback slider during play at
		speed have no immediate effect. However, the seek commands work as normal.</li>
	</ul>

	

	<h2 id="moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor</h2>
	
	<p>Audacity has a cursor to specify a particular time during the
	audio, for example, the start of playback, the position where you
	want to start selecting a time range,
	or the position where audio is pasted from the clipboard.</p>
	
	<p>Reading the current position of the cursor is described in one of the following
	sections, and the ways of moving the cursor are as follows:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To move the cursor to the start of the tracks (time zero),
		press <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the cursor to the end of all the audio, press <strong>End</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the cursor to the start or end of the audio in
		the selected tracks press <strong>J</strong> or <strong>K</strong>
		respectively.</li>		
		
		<li>You can move backward or forward by either a short or long period,
		as long as the focus is in the Track view table. To move backward or
		forward by a short period, press <strong>Comma</strong> or
		<strong>Period</strong> respectively. To move backward or forward
		by a long period, press <strong>Shift + Comma</strong> or
		<strong>Shift + Period</strong> respectively. These short and
		long periods share the same values as the short and long periods
		used for seeking/jumping during playback, which was described
		in the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#playback">Playback section</a>. The size of
		both the short and long periods can be set in the Preferences
		dialog, as described in the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#seek-times">Seek times section</a>.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Left Arrow</strong> and <strong>Right Arrow</strong> keys.
		If the focus is in the Track view table, then pressing
		<strong>Left Arrow</strong> or <strong>Right Arrow</strong> moves
		the cursor to the left or right by a small amount respectively.
		Adjusting the step size is described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#step-size">Step size of the left an right arrow keys</a> section
		below.</li>
		
		<li>Pressing <strong>X</strong> stops playback, and moves the cursor
		to the position where the playback stopped. You can also use this keystroke
		to start playback.</li>

		<li>You can press and hold either <strong>U</strong> or <strong>I</strong> to
		scrub backwards or forwards respectively. When you release the key, the cursor
		is positioned at that time. See the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#scrubbing">Scrubbing section</a> below for a full description
		of scrubbing.</li>
		
		<li>The <strong>Left Bracket</strong> key during playback. This key is the first
		key to the right of the letter <strong>P</strong> key. Although the Narrator
		screen reader reads this key as Left square bracket, both Jaws and NVDA
		read it as left bracket, and it will be referred to as left bracket in this
		guide. If during playback
		you press <strong>Left Bracket</strong> and then <strong>Spacebar</strong> to stop,
		the cursor is moved to the point in the audio where you pressed
		the <strong>Left Bracket</strong> key.</li>
						
		<li>The Start spin box on the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#selection-toolbar">Selection toolbar</a>. This is described in detail
		in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#moving-the-cursor-with-the-selection-start-control">Moving the cursor with the Start of selection control</a> section below.</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h3>The time selection controls when there is a cursor</h3>

	<p>In Audacity, there is either a cursor or a selected time range.
	When there is a cursor, then the times shown by the controls for start
	of the selection are the same as the times shown by the controls for the end
	of the selection, and these times are the position of the cursor. Because
	of this, we can use the start of selection controls for reading and changing
	the position of the cursor, as described in the next two sections.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Reading the position of the cursor</h3>
	
	<p>There are a couple of ways of reading the cursor position. The first
	is to read the Start of selection control on the Selection toolbar:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Assuming that the Track view table is the focus, press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong>
		to move to the Lower toolbars, where the first toolbar is the selection toolbar.</li>
		
		<li>If necessary, <strong>Tab</strong> until you get to the Start control,
		which contains the cursor position, and which your screen reader reads out. Note
		that when returning to the Lower toolbars, the control that was previously
		the focus is the focus again, so you often don't have to <strong>Tab</strong>
		to the Start control.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> twice or <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F6</strong>
		to return to the Track view table.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The second way of reading the cursor position is to open the Set left
	selection boundary dialog:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Whilst there is no playback, press the <strong>Left Bracket</strong> key to open the Set left selection
		boundary dialog.</li>
		
		<li>The position control is the initial focus, and its value is
		the cursor position. Press <strong>Esc</strong> to close the dialog.</li>
	</ol>	
	
	
	<h3 id="moving-the-cursor-with-the-selection-start-control">Moving the cursor using the Start of selection control</h3>
	
   <ol>
	   <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the Lower toolbars, where the
	   first toolbar is the selection toolbar.</li>
      
       <li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Show box, and make
       sure that the Start and length of selection option is selected. If it's set to
	   Start and end of selection, then you can accidentally select a time range,
	   instead of moving the cursor, as described in the next section.</li>
      
       <li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Start control, and change its
	   value using one of two ways described in the  as described in the
	   <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#edit-spin-boxes">Edit spin boxes section</a>.</li>
      
       <li>To return to the Track view table, press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong>
       twice.</li>
   </ol>
	
	
	<h4>Reason for setting the Start and length of selection option</h4>
	
	<p>With no time range selected, consider the two cases:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The Show combo box set to Start and length of selection. The start control
		displays the cursor position, and the length control displays
		zero. If you change value of the start control, then the
		length control always remains unchanged at zero.</li>
		
		<li>The Show combo box set to Start and end of selection. The start and
		end controls both display the same value, which is the cursor position.
		If you increase the value of the start control, then the
		value of the end control is automatically increased to the same
		value. However, if you decrease the value of the start control,
		then the end control remains unchanged. So you've accidentally
		selected a time range.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="step-size">Step size of the left and right arrow keys</h3>
	
	<p>This section describes how the step size of the left and right
	arrow keys depend on the horizontal zoom of the audio data, and how
	to set the amount of zoom so that the step size has suitable values. The same step sizes
	are also used by the <strong>Shift + Left or Right Arrow</strong> and
	<strong>Ctrl + Shift + Left or Right Arrow</strong> keystrokes for
	expanding or contracting selected time ranges.</p>
	
	<p>Audacity has the ability to vary the amount by which the audio data is zoomed in the
	horizontal direction. This allows sighted users to view the audio data in
	either more or less detail, depending on the task.</p>
	
	<p>Pressing <strong>Right Arrow</strong> or <strong>Left Arrow</strong>
	moves the cursor by the same physical distance on the screen, whatever the
	amount of horizontal zoom. So if the amount of zoom is increased, then
	the time by which the cursor is moved is decreased. Similarly, if the
	amount of zoom is decreased, then the time by which the cursor is moved
	is increased.</p>
	
	<p>After opening or importing a file, the horizontal zoom is adjusted
	so that the longest track in the project takes up the available space in
	the track in the window. So the initial amount of zoom, and so the step
	size of the arrow keys depends on the length of the tracks.</p>
	
	<p>However, you can set the horizontal zoom to a predefined amount. You
	can do this by opening the view menu, opening the zoom sub menu,
	and choosing Zoom Normal (<strong>Ctrl + 2</strong>).
	When the zoom is set to normal, then the left and right arrow keys move
	the cursor by slightly more than one hundredth of a second. This step
	size is normally too small to be useful. However, you can easily
	adjust the step size using the zoom in and zoom out commands which
	are also available on the Zoom sub menu on the View menu:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Zoom In (<strong>Ctrl + 1</strong>). This doubles the zoom, and
		so halves the step size of the left and right arrow keys.</li>
		
		<li>Zoom Out (<strong>Ctrl + 3</strong>). This halves the zoom,
		and so doubles the step size of the left and right arrow keys.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>So, for example, after setting the zoom to normal (<strong>Ctrl + 2</strong>),
	which sets the step size to slightly more than one hundredth of a second,
	if you zoom out (<strong>Ctrl + 3</strong>) three times, this multiplies the
	step size by 8, resulting in a step size which is slightly less
	than a tenth of a second. As another example, if you press <strong>Ctrl + 2</strong>,
	and then <strong>Ctrl + 3</strong> 7 times, then the step size is about
	one and a half seconds.</p>


	<h3 id="scrubbing">Scrubbing</h3>

	<p>The use of the word scrubbing in audio editors originates from editing using reel
	to reel tape machines. The tape was moved backwards and forwards over the tape head
	to find the precise position for an edit. In Audacity, there are two commands for scrubbing
	which are of interest to keyboard users: Scrub backwards which has the keystroke U,
	and Scrub forwards, which has the keystroke I. By pressing and holding one these keys
	you can play either backwards or forwards. The speed of playback depends on Audacity's horizontal
	zoom setting, and so by changing this you can have the audio played back at a wide range of speeds.</p>

	<p>If you are using the Jaws screen reader, and its typing echo setting is set to characters,
	which is the default, then if you press and hold one of keys for scrubbing, you will hear
	the name of the key being repeated while you scrub. To avoid this, you can temporarily set
	the typing echo to none. To do this, press <strong>Insert + 2</strong> until you hear the
	word none, and use the same keystroke to set the typing echo back to characters.</p>

	<p>If no time range is selected, and you press and hold one of the scrubbing keys, then
	playback starts at the cursor. When you release the key, playback stops and the cursor
	is positioned at this time. Alternatively, If a time range is selected, and you press and
	hold one of the scrubbing keys, then playback starts at the start of the selection.
	Unlike during normal playback, if the end of the selected time range is reached, playback
	doesn't automatically stop. When the key is released, the selected time range is deselected,
	and the cursor is positioned at the time the key was released.</p>

	<p>If you press and hold one of these keys, and whilst still holding it, press
	and hold the other key, then playback immediately changes direction, and does not stop
	when you release the original key.</p>

	<p>The playback speed for these commands depends on Audacity's horizontal zoom setting.
	This can be set using the commands on the zoom sub menu, which is on the View menu:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Zoom normal (<strong>Ctrl + 2</strong>), sets a playback speed of half the normal playback speed.</li>

		<li>Zoom In (<strong>Ctrl + 1</strong>), halves the playback speed. There's
		a minimum speed of one sixteenth of the normal playback speed.</li>

		<li>Zoom Out (<strong>Ctrl + 3</strong>), doubles the playback speed. There's
		a maximum speed of three times the normal playback speed.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You can position the cursor more accurately using lower playback speeds, and you may find
	that a playback speed of one quarter is a useful choice for the speed. The accuracy of the
	positioning of the cursor also depends on the Audio interface which Audacity communicates with
	your audio devices. The choice of interfaces is described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#audio-interface">Audio interface section</a> later in the guide. Using the WASAPI interface
	will give you the most accurate positioning.</p>

	<p>In the above description, it's been said that when one of the scrubbing keys is released, the
	cursor is positioned at the time the key is released. However, there is an exception to this if either the
	<strong>Left bracket</strong> or <strong>Right bracket</strong> key has been pressed during playback.
	In this case, the time selection present when the scrubbing key is released is preserved. This behaviour
	allows scrubbing to one of the options described in the section
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#one-general-method">One general method for selecting a time range</a>.</p>


		 	
	<h2 id="selecting-audio">Selecting audio</h2>

	<p>In the case of an audio editor which can only edit a single audio track,
	then selecting audio simply consists of specifying the start and end times
	of the audio which you want to select, that is, a time range. For example
	you might want to select the audio between the times 1 minute 2 seconds and
	5 minutes 23 seconds.</p>

	<p>However, Audacity is a multi-track editor. If the project consists of a number
	of tracks, then you may want to select the audio on only some of the tracks for
	a given time range. So in Audacity, as well as having to select a time range,
	you also have to specify which tracks are selected. The selection of
	tracks was described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#track-selection">track selection</a> section above, and
	selecting a time range is described in the following sections.</p>

	<p>Using Audacity's default settings, if you try to perform some action on some audio,
	such as applying an effect, and in fact no audio is selected, then a dialog
	opens, telling you that no audio is selected. However, there is an auto select
	option, and if that is turned on, then instead of the dialog appearing, all the
	audio in the project is selected, and the effect is applied to this audio. For users of
	screen readers, it is recommended that you leave this option off, but full
	details of the option and its setting are described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#auto-select">Auto-select section</a> of the Preferences section.
	All the instructions in the remainder of this guide assume that the option is off.</p>


	<h3>Selecting a time range</h3>
	
	<p>A quick way of selecting all of the audio in the project is to
	use the shortcut <strong>Ctrl + A</strong>: this selects all the
	tracks, and selects a time range which includes all the audio.</p>
	
	<p>There are two general ways of selecting a time range. One of these
	is described in the next section, and the other
	method is described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#selecting-a-time-range-using">Selecting a time range using the stored cursor position</a>
	section below. After this, there are sections on useful playback commands,
	making fine adjustments to time ranges, and how to deselect time ranges.</p>


	<h3 id="one-general-method">One general method of selecting a time range</h3>
	
	<p>The first general way of selecting a time range consists of two steps:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move the cursor to where you want to start or end the selection, using
		one of the methods described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor section</a> above.</li>
		
		<li>Set the other end of the selection using one of the methods described
		below.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Note that when a time range is selected, playback plays the selected
	time range. There are also a number of additional playback commands which
	are described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#playback-commands-for-checking">Playback commands for checking a selected time range section</a>.</p>
	
	<p>You can use any of the following methods for setting the other end of the selection:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>With the cursor at the position where you want the start of the
		selection, to set the end of the selection at the end of the audio in the
		selected tracks, press <strong>Shift + K</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>With the cursor positioned where you want the end of the selection,
		to set the start of the selection at the start of the audio in the selected tracks,
		press <strong>Shift + J</strong>.</li>

		<li>Set the end of the selection using the <strong>Right Bracket</strong> key during playback.
		This key is the second key to the right of the letter <strong>P</strong> key.
		Although the Narrator screen reader reads this key as Right square bracket, both Jaws and NVDA
		read it as Right bracket, and it will be referred to as Right bracket in this guide.
		If during playback you press <strong>Right Bracket</strong> and then <strong>Spacebar</strong> to stop,
		the end of the selection is set at the point in the audio where you pressed
		the <strong>Right Bracket</strong> key.</li>

		<li>Set the end of the selection using the <strong>Right Bracket</strong> key whilst
		scrubbing forwards. Press and hold down the <strong>I</strong> key to scrub forwards. Press
		the <strong>Right bracket</strong> key at the time you want to be the end of the selection,
		and then release the <strong>I</strong> key.</li>

		<li>Similarly, you can set the start of the selection using the <strong>Left bracket</strong>
		key, whilst scrubbing backwards. Press and hold down the <strong>U</strong> key to scrub
		backwards. Press the <strong>Left bracket</strong> key at the time you want to be the
		start of the selection, and then release the <strong>U</strong> key.</li>

		<li>With the cursor at the position where you want the start of the
		selection, to set the end of the selection at the end of all the audio,
		press <strong>Shift + End</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>With the cursor positioned where you want the end of the selection,
		to set the start of the selection at the start of the tracks (time zero),
		press <strong>Shift + Home</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>Using the selection controls on the selection toolbar.</li>
		
		<li>Using <strong>Shift + Left Arrow</strong> or <strong>Shift + Right Arrow</strong>.
		With the cursor positioned where you want the start of the selection,
		you can press <strong>Shift + Right Arrow</strong> one or more times
		to move the end of the selection to the right in small steps.
		Similarly, with the cursor position where you want the end of the
		selection, you can press <strong>Shift + Left Arrow</strong> one or more
		times to move the start of the selection to the left. Adjusting the step size
		is described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#step-size">Step size of the left an right arrow keys section</a>
		above. Note that Track view table must be the focus to use these keystrokes.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Examples</h4>

	<p>In the following examples, it's assumed that one track is selected, and any other tracks
	are not selected. In the cases which involve pressing a key during playback, then in practice,
	you'd probably want to then make small adjustments to the selection, as described in a section below.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To select a time range which covers all the audio in the selected track.
		Press <strong>J</strong> to move the cursor to the start of the audio, and then press
		<strong>Shift + K</strong> to set the end of the selection at the end of the audio.
		An obvious alternative would be to press <strong>K</strong>,
		and then <strong>Shift + J</strong>.</li>

		<li>To select a few seconds at the start of the audio in the selected track.
		First press <strong>J</strong>, to move the cursor to the start of the audio,
		and then press <strong>Spacebar</strong>
		to start playback. When you get to the point which you want to be the end of the time
		range, press <strong>X</strong> to stop the playback, and move the cursor to that point.
		Finally, press <strong>Shift + J</strong> to set the start of the selection at the
		start of the audio.</li>

		<li>To select a few seconds at the end of the audio in the selected track.
		First press <strong>K</strong> to move the cursor to the end of the audio. Then press
		<strong>Comma</strong> a few times, till the cursor is a little before the time
		which you want to be the start of the time range. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong>,
		to start playback, and then press <strong>X</strong> when you get to the point which
		you want to be the start of the time range. Finally, press <strong>Shift + K</strong>
		to set the end of the selection at the end of the audio.</li>

		<li>To select a few seconds somewhere in the selected track. Press <strong>
		Spacebar</strong> to start playback, then press <strong>Left Bracket</strong> at
		the point which you want to be the start of the selection, then press
		<strong>Right Bracket</strong> at the point you want to be the end of the selection,
		and finally <strong>Spacebar</strong> to stop playback.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="selecting-a-time-range-using">Selecting a time range using the stored cursor position</h3>
	
	<p>The second general method of selecting a time range consists of four steps:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move the cursor to where you want to start or end the selection, using
		one of the methods described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor section</a> above.</li>
		
		<li>Open the Select menu, and choose Store Cursor position.</li>
		
		<li>Set the other end of the selection, again using
		using one of the methods described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor section</a> above.</li>
		
		<li>Open the Select menu, and choose Cursor to Stored Cursor position.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>In some circumstances, this method is easier to use than the method described in
	the previous section. Having stored the cursor position, you can use what ever method
	you want to position the cursor at the other end of the time range you want to select,
	without any danger that you'll loose the other end of the selection.</p>
	
	<p>Note that during playback, including when paused, the Store Cursor position command stores
	the position of the playback cursor, rather than the cursor used for editing. However, it's normally
	easier to position the edit cursor precisely where you want it, and so for selecting a time
	range, you probably won't want to store the position of the playback cursor very often.
	Similarly, during playback, including when paused,  the Cursor to Stored Cursor
	position on the Select sub menu selects from the position of the playback cursor
	to the stored cursor position.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="playback-commands-for-checking">Playback commands for checking a selected time range</h3>
	
	<p>When a time range is selected, then if you press <strong>Spacebar</strong> for playback,
	only the audio in the selected time range is played. In addition you can use
	the following playback commands to check that you've selected the time range which you want:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To play a short period before or after selection start, press <strong>Shift + F5</strong>
		or <strong>Shift + F6</strong> respectively.</li>
		
		<li>To play a short period before or after selection end, press <strong>Shift + F7</strong>
		or <strong>Shift + F8</strong> respectively.</li>
		
		<li>To play a cut preview, press <strong>C</strong>. This plays back a short period before selection
		start, and then a short period after selection end. The selected time range itself is omitted.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The settings for the length of these periods all share the settings of the play
	cut preview command, and can be set in the playback category of Preferences.</p>
	
		
	<h3 id="adjusting-a-selected-time-range">Adjusting a selected time range</h3>
	
	<p>There are a couple of ways of making small adjustments to
	a selected time range, and they are described in the next two sections.</p>
	

	<h4>Adjusting the selected time range using keystrokes to move the start or end of the selection</h4>
	
	<p>You can use the following keystrokes to move the start or end
	of the selection by a small amount. Adjusting the step size
	is described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#step-size">Step size of the left an right arrow keys section</a> above.</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li>To move the end of the selection to the right, so
		expanding the time range, press <strong>Shift + Right Arrow</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the end of the selection to the left, so
		contracting the time range, press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the start of the selection to the right, so
		contracting the time range, press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the start of the selection to the left, so
		expanding the time range, press <strong>Shift + Left Arrow</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
			
	<p>Note that the two keystrokes that use <strong>Ctrl</strong>
	contract the selected time range, and the other two keystrokes expand
	the selected time range.</p>

	
	<h4 id="adjusting-using-the-selection-controls">Adjusting the selected time-range using the selection controls</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>If the current focus is the Track view table, then press
		<strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the Lower toolbars, where
		the first toolbar is the selection toolbar.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Show combo box, and set the
		Start and end of selection option. This allows you to adjust the Start or the End of the
		selection without affecting the other one.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to either the start or the
		end control.</li>
		
		<li>If, for example, you want to adjust the time in tenths of a
		second, and the time format is hh:mm:ss + hundredths, then
		press <strong>End</strong> to move to the last digit,
		and then press <strong>Left Arrow</strong> to move to the
		tenths of a second digit. You can then press <strong>Up Arrow</strong>
		or <strong>Down Arrow</strong> to increase or decrease the time by
		a tenth of a second respectively.</li>
		
		<li>Adjust the other selection control if desired.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> twice to return to the tracks.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3>Deselecting a selected time range</h3>

	<p>If you press any of the following keystrokes which move the cursor,
	then any selected time range is deselected: <strong>Home</strong>, <strong>End</strong>,
	<strong>J</strong>, <strong>K</strong>, <strong>Left Arrow</strong>,
	<strong>Right Arrow</strong>, <strong>Comma</strong>, and <strong>Period</strong>.
	After you have pressed <strong>Left Arrow</strong>
	or <strong>Right Arrow</strong>, then the cursor position
	is at the start or end of the selection which has just been deselected.</p>
	
	<p>To deselect all the tracks, and deselect any time-range, press
	<strong>Ctrl + Shift + A</strong>. The new cursor position is at
	the start of the selection which has just been deselected.</p>
	
	
	<h2 id="basic-editing">Basic editing</h2>
	
	<h3>Undo and redo</h3>
	
	<p>To undo press <strong>Ctrl + Z</strong>,
	and to redo press <strong>Ctrl + Y</strong>.</p>
	

	<h3>Deleting audio</h3>

	<p>To delete the selected audio, press the <strong>Delete</strong> key.</p>
	
	<p>If you want a preview of the audio after deletion,
	press <strong>C</strong> which plays back from a short time before
	the selected audio to a short time after the selected audio, but
	omitting the selected audio. The length of the times of playback before
	and after the selection can be set in the Cut Preview group of
	the Playback category in the Preferences dialog.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Cut</h3>
	
	<p>To cut the selected audio, press <strong>Ctrl+ X</strong>. The selected audio
	is removed from the tracks, and placed on the Audacity clipboard.</p>
	
	<p>As in the case of deleting audio, you can preview the effect of your cut by
	pressing <strong>C</strong> for Play cut preview.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Copy</h3>
	
	<p>To copy the selected audio onto the Audacity clipboard, press <strong>Ctrl + C</strong>.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="paste">Paste</h3>
	
	<p>To paste the audio on the Audacity clipboard into the selected track or tracks,
	press <strong>Ctrl + V</strong>. There are two cases:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If a time range is not selected, and so no audio is selected,
		then the audio is inserted at the position of the cursor.</li>
		
		<li>If some audio is selected, the selected audio is replaced
		by the pasted audio.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If no tracks are selected when you paste some audio, then the audio is inserted
	at the beginning of a new track.</p>
	
	<p>There are a couple of convenient playback commands which can be used
	for checking that the transition at the start and end of the pasted audio sounds alright:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To play a short period before and after selection start,
		press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F5</strong></li>
		
		<li>To play a short period before and after selection end,
		press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F7</strong></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The settings for the length of these periods share the settings of the play
	cut preview command, and can be set in the playback category of Preferences.</p>

	
	<h3>Replace with silence</h3>

	<p>To replace the selected audio with the same length of silence,
	on the Edit Menu, open the Remove Special sub menu, and choose
	Silence Audio (<strong>Ctrl + L</strong>).</p>


	<h3>Insert silence</h3>
	
	<p>To insert a period of silence into the selected tracks:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Move the cursor to where you want to insert the silence.</li>

		<li>Choose Silence from the Generate menu.</li>

		<li>A Silence Generator dialog opens, and the focus is a spin box
		which allows you to specify the length of the silence. The spin box
		is identical to the spin boxes used on the Selection toolbar, though the
		first non-zero digit is the initial focus, rather than the first digit.
			
		 	<p>Set the time that you want,
			and then press <strong>Enter</strong> to press the default OK button.
			The period of silence is inserted, and a time-range which covers
			this period is selected.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Note that all the commands on the Generate menu have the following behaviour.
	If one or more tracks are selected, but no time-range, then the generated
	audio is inserted at the cursor. However, if a time-range is also selected,
	then the selected audio is replaced by the generated audio. Also, all the spin
	boxes in the dialogs which are opened from the Generate menu have a default
	format of seconds, and the first non-zero digit is the initial focus, rather
	than the first digit.</p>


	<h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>

	<p>Audacity provides a large number of effects which are available on the
	Effects menu. Some of the commands, like fade in or fade out,
	simply execute the effect on the selected audio, but most of them
	open a dialog box so that you can adjust the parameters for the
	effect.</p>
	
	<p>If an effect does not support real-time preview, which is
	described in the next section, then its dialog nearly always
	contains a Preview button which
	allows you to hear a short sample of the effect applied to the
	selected audio. By default, the length of the preview is 6 seconds, but you
	can change this in the Preferences dialog, where in the Playback
	category, in the Effects Preview group, there's a Length edit box.</p>
	
	<p>The effect's dialog also contains a Manage button, which
	opens a menu which includes commands for presets.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Effects with real-time preview</h4>
	
	<p>Some of the effects which can be used Audacity include real-time
	preview  where you can change the settings of an effect during
	playback. A small number of the effects included with Audacity's installation,
	for example, the bass and treble effect and the wahwah effect,
	have this feature. In addition, if you have downloaded
	any VST or LADSPA effects, then these have real-time preview.</p>
	
	<p>The dialogs of effects which include real-time preview include the
	following controls, all of which have access keys:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Apply button, which applies the effect to the selected audio,
		and is the dialog's default button. Note that as with any other
		Apply button, it doesn't close the dialog.</li>
		
		<li>Close button (<strong>Esc</strong>).</li>
		
		<li>Manage button. This opens a menu which includes commands for presets,
		and opening an options dialog.</li>
		
		<li>Start/Stop Playback button. If you press Stop Playback during
		playback, and then press Start Playback, then playback resumes from
		where it was stopped.</li>
		
		<li>Skip Backward button. During playback, pressing this seeks backward
		by a short period. Otherwise, pressing it ensures that the next playback
		starts at the start of the selected time range.</li>
		
		<li>Skip Forward button. During playback, pressing this seeks forward
		by a short period. Otherwise, pressing it causes the next playback to
		start at the end of the selected time range.</li>
		
		<li>Enable check box. This sets whether the effect is enabled, and is
		checked by default. Unchecking this allows you to quickly compare the
		audio with and without the effect.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>After opening one of these effect dialogs, you can return to the main
	Audacity window without closing it. Dialogs with this behaviour are known
	as modeless dialogs. You can cycle round the Audacity main window and any
	open modeless dialogs by pressing <strong>Alt + F6</strong>. Because these
	effect dialogs have their own playback controls, you may not need to make
	use of the behaviour very often.</p>

	
	<h3>Deleting tracks</h3>

	<p>There are two ways of deleting tracks:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To delete the focused track, press <strong>Shift + C</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To delete the selected track or tracks, choose Remove Tracks
		from the Tracks menu. This provides a quick way of deleting all
		the tracks if you first press <strong>Ctrl + A</strong>
		to make sure that all the tracks are selected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>Avoiding introducing clicks when editing</h3>
	
	<p>If you delete or cut part of the audio in a track, and if the beginning or
	end of this part hasn't zero amplitude, then this can result if sudden changes
	in the amplitude of the audio. If the size of these sudden changes are large enough,
	then you'll hear them as clicks. A similar problem can occur if you copy and paste audio.</p>
	
	<p>You can avoid introducing these clicks by using the At Zero Crossings
	command, which is on the Select menu, and has the shortcut <strong>Z</strong>.
	If a track is selected, but there isn't a selected time range,
	then if you apply this command, the position of the cursor is moved to
	the nearest position where the amplitude of the audio in the selected track is zero.
	The change is position is very small, so you don't have to worry that this will make
	a large change to the cursor position. In a similar manner, if there's a selected time range,
	the positions of both the start and the end of the time range are adjusted so that the
	amplitude of the audio in the selected track is zero.</p>
	
	<p>So to avoid introducing clicks:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>After selecting part of the audio in a track, and before cutting, deleting or
		copying, apply the At Zero Crossings command.</li>
		
		<li>After you've positioned the cursor for pasting audio into a track, and
		before pasting, apply the At Zero Crossings command.</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h2 id="editing-multiple-tracks">Editing when there are multiple tracks</h2>

	<p>This section describes some commands and settings which are relevant
	when you want to work on a project which contains more than one track.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="importing-audio-files">Importing audio files</h3>
	
	<p>You can import one or more audio files,
	and these become new tracks in the existing project. 
	To import standard audio file(s), open the
	File menu, and choose Audio from the Import sub-menu (<strong>Ctrl + Shift + I</strong>).
	A Select one or more audio files dialog opens, which
	has the same structure as a standard Windows XP Open dialog. Select one or
	more files, and press <strong>Enter</strong> to press the OK button.</p>
	
	<p>Note that immediately after the import, the last track in the
	project is selected, and all other tracks are unselected.</p>


	<h3>Adding a new empty track</h3>
	
	<p>To add a new empty track, choose an option from the Add New
	sub-menu which is on the Tracks menu.</p>


	<h3>Duplicate</h3>
	
	<p>To duplicate the selected audio into new track or tracks, open
	the Edit menu and choose Duplicate (<strong>Ctrl + D</strong>).
	The duplicated audio retains the same timings as the original selected audio,
	so in the new track or tracks the audio data starts at the start of the selected
	time range.</p>


	<h3>Track Mute and Solo</h3>

	<p>Each track can be muted and soloed. These settings are used to
	control which tracks contribute to playback, and to the audio
	saved in one of the standard formats. By default, a track is
	neither muted or soled. After reading the name of the track,
	your screen reader says the words muted and soloed if this is the case.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Mute</h4>
	
	<p>If a track is muted, then it doesn't contribute to playback, or
	to the audio saved in one of the standard formats. There are a number of
	commands for changing whether or not tracks are muted:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To toggle the Mute setting of the focused track, press
		<strong>Shift + U</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To mute all the tracks, press <strong>Ctrl + U</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To set mute off for all the tracks, press
		<strong>Ctrl + Shift + U</strong>.</li>

		<li>To mute all the selected tracks, press <strong>Ctrl + Alt + U</strong>.</li>

		<li>To unmute all the selected tracks, press <strong>Ctrl + Alt + Shift + U</strong>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>All apart from the first of these commands can be found on the Mute/unmute sub
	menu of the Tracks menu.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Solo</h4>
	
	<p>If one or more tracks is soloed, then only these
	tracks contribute to playback or to the audio saved in one of the standard
	formats, regardless of the Mute settings of all of the tracks.
	To toggle whether or not the focussed track is soloed,
	press <strong>Shift + S</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of options for the solo setting and its interaction with
	the mute setting:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Simple, which is the default. When you solo
		a track, then the mute and solo settings of the tracks are adjusted so that
		the soloed track is not muted, and the remaining tracks are muted and not soloed.
		If you unsolo a soloed track, then all the remaining tracks are unmuted.</li>
		
		<li>Multi-track. The mute and solo settings are completely independent, and
		any number of tracks can be soloed.</li>
		
		<li>None. There's no solo setting, just a mute setting.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The setting which has these options can be found by going to the Tracks Behaviors
	category of the Preferences dialog, where there is a Solo button combo box.</p>


	<h3>Track gain</h3>
	
	<p>To change the gain of the focused track, press <strong>Shift + G</strong>.
	A Gain dialog opens which contains both an edit box and a slider for changing the gain.
	The range of gain (db) is -36 to +36.</p>
	
	<p>The gain of a track is applied to the whole track, and is only
	applied during playback, or when the track is exported to a file, or when you
	use the mix and render command. Changing the gain doesn't affect
	the amplitude of the audio data in the track.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Track pan</h3>
	
	<p>To change the pan of the focused track, press
	<strong>Shift + P</strong>. A Pan dialog opens which contains both
	an edit box and a slider for changing the pan.
	The range of pan is -1 to 1, corresponding to left and right.</p>


	<h3 id="track-menu">Track menu</h3>
	
	<p>You can open the menu of a focused track by pressing <strong>Shift + M</strong>,
	or the <strong>Application key</strong>.
	The commands on the menu include renaming the track, and moving
    the track, and the latter is described in the next section.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="moving-a-track">Moving a track</h3>
	
	<p>On the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#track-menu">Track menu</a> there are commands for moving
	a track up, down, to the top, and to the bottom of the tracks. By default,
	these commands to not have keystrokes assigned to them, but you can assign
	your own keystrokes in the keyboard category of Preferences, which is described
	in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts section</a>, which is in
	the Preferences section. The names of
	the commands are move focused track up, down, to top, and to bottom.
	Keystrokes which are not currently used and are suitable include <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Up Arrow</strong>,
	<strong>Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow</strong>, <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Home</strong>,
	and <strong>Ctrl + Shift + End</strong>.</p>


    <h3 id="align-the-audio-in-the-tracks-end-to-end">Align the audio in tracks end to end</h3>
    
    <p>If you select two or more tracks, you can align the audio in these
    tracks so that the audio in a track starts at the end of the audio
    in the previous track. To do this, open the tracks menu, open the
    Align tracks sub menu, and choose Align end to end. Notes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The order in which the audio in the selected tracks is aligned is the same
        as the order of these tracks in the track view table. If you need to
        change the order of the tracks in the table, you can do this using
        commands on a track's <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#track-menu">track menu</a>.</li>
        
        <li>The position of the audio in the first selected track remains
        unchanged.</li>
    </ul>

	
	<h3>Time shift</h3>
	
	<p>You can time shift the audio data in one or more selected tracks so that
	either the start or the end of the audio is at some desired position.
	You can specify this position either with the cursor, or the start or
	end of a selected time range. All the commands for moving the audio
	are available on the Align Tracks sub menu which is on the Tracks menu,
	and some examples of using them are given below.</p>
	
	<p>There are a couple of convenient playback commands which can be used
	for checking the position of the shifted audio:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To play a short period before and after the cursor, or selection start,
		press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F5</strong></li>
		
		<li>To play a short period before and after selection end,
		press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F7</strong></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The settings for the length of these periods share the settings of the play
	cut preview command, and can be set in the playback category of Preferences.</p>
	
	<h4>Examples</h4>
	
	<p>To move the audio in one or more tracks so that it
	starts at some desired time:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move the cursor to the desired time, using any of the methods
		described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor section</a>.</li>
		
		<li>Select the tracks containing the audio you want to move,
		and make sure that the other tracks are not selected.</li>
		
		<li>Open the Align Tracks sub menu on the Tracks menu, and choose
		Start to Cursor/Selection Start. Note that if more than one track has been selected,
		and the audio in these tracks start at different times, then the
		audio in all the tracks is moved by the same amount, so that the
		earliest audio in the tracks is positioned at the cursor.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>If you'd wanted to move the audio in one or more tracks so that it
	ended at some desired time, then you'd simply change step three to use
	the End to Cursor/Selection Start command, instead of Start to Cursor/Selection Start.</p>
	
	<p>As another example, if you want to time shift one or more tracks by a certain amount
	of time, then:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Select one or more tracks that you want to time shift, and make
		sure that the other tracks are not selected.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>J</strong> to  move the cursor to the start of the
		audio in the selected tracks.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the Lower toolbars,
		where the first toolbar is the selection toolbar.
		Then <strong>Tab</strong> to the Show combo box, and make sure
		that the start and length option is selected.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Start spin-box.</li>
		
		<li>Depending on whether you want to time shift forward or backward,
		you now need to move the cursor forward or backward by incrementing
		or decrementing the time in the spin-box. For example,
		if you want to move the audio forward by 1.5 seconds, then
		use the following keystrokes to increment the time : <strong>End</strong> moves you to
		right most digit, which is hundredths of seconds; <strong>Left Arrow</strong>
		moves you to the tenths of second digit;
		<strong>Up Arrow</strong> five times increments this digit by five;
		<strong>Left Arrow</strong> moves you to the seconds digit;
		and finally, <strong>Up Arrow</strong> increments this digit by one.</li>
		
		<li>Go to the Align tracks sub-menu on the Tracks menu, and choose
		Start to Cursor/Selection Start. This moves the data in the selected selected tracks,
		so that is now starts at the modified cursor position.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Note that if you're wanting to move a track which you've recorded and
	which doesn't line up with the existing tracks, then you may need to move
	the start of the audio to earlier than
	time zero. Because you can't move the cursor before time zero,
	the above method has to be modified so that
	in step two, you press <strong>K</strong> to move to the end of the audio
	in the selected tracks, and then in step five, you use the End to Cursor/Selection Start
	command. Note that Audacity does have an automatic
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#latency-compensation">latency compensation</a>.</p>


	<h3 id="fades">Fades</h3>

	<p>When you've got more than one track in the project, you may well want to
	fade some tracks when the audio in other tracks starts and ends. For example,
	if there's some introductory music before the start of some spoken audio,
	you may want to start fading the music down just before the start of the speech.
	The fade up and down effects have been mentioned already in the guide, and these
	simply fade up or down with the start and end of the fades being either
	zero or 100 percent of the original amplitude. The next two sections
	describe the Auto duck and Adjustable fade effects, which enable you to
	do more complex fades.</p>


	<h4>Auto Duck effect</h4>
	
	<p>The Auto Duck effect reduces the volume in the selected audio during the
	periods in which the level of another track, known as the control track,
	exceeds a certain threshold. The track which is used as the control track
	is the last unselected track which is immediately below a selected track.</p>
	
	<p>So, for example, if you've got one music track, and one voice track in
	the project, and you want to reduce the volume of the music when there's
	speech in the voice track:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Make sure that the music track is the first track. If it isn't, you
		can move a track up or down the track table by opening its menu, and
		choosing Move Track Up or Move Track Down respectively.</li>
		
		<li>Make sure that the voice track is not selected.</li>
		
		<li>Select all the audio in the music track. To do this, first make sure that the
		track is selected. Then select a time range that includes all the
		audio in the track: press <strong>J</strong> to move the cursor to
		the start of the audio in the selected track, and then press
		<strong>Shift + K</strong> to select from the cursor to the end of the
		audio in the selected track.</li>
		
		<li>On the Effects menu, open the Auto Duck dialog, and if you've
		happy with the default settings, then just press <strong>Enter</strong>
		to press the default OK button.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<p>These are the various Auto Duck settings:</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li>Duck amount. This is the amount of volume reduction of the selected
		audio during the periods when the level in the control tracks exceeds
		the threshold. Its default value is -12dB.</li>
	
		<li>Maximum pause. If the time between two periods when the level in the control
		track exceeds the threshold is less than the Maximim pause parameter, then
		the selected audio continues to be ducked in this time  there isn't
		a fade up and then a fade down. If for example the control track contains
		speech, then if there are pauses less than the maximum pause, then
		the selected audio continues to be ducked during this period. The default
		value of Maximum pause is 1 second. Note that regardless of this setting
		the Maximum pause is always at least the sum of the outer fade lengths,
		which are described below.</li>   	
		
		<li>Fade lengths. The time over which the volume in the selected audio is faded down
		to the reduced volume is made up of two parts. The volume of the
		selected audio can start to fade down before the level in the control
		track starts exceeding the threshold. This time interval is
		known as the outer fade down length, because it occurs outside of the time
		when the threshold is exceeded, and its default value is 0.5 seconds.
		In addition, the volume can finish fading down after the threshold starts
		to be exceeded. This interval is known as the inner fade down length, because it occurs
		inside the time when the threshold is exceeded, and its default value
		is 0 seconds.
		
			<p>In an entirely similar manner, the time over which the volume in the selected
			audio is faded back up is also made up of two parts: the inner and the outer
			fade up lengths, which have default values of 0 and 0.5 seconds respectively.</p>
		</li>
			
		<li>Threshold. The selected audio is ducked during the periods when
		the level in the control track exceeds this threshold, and its default
		value is -30dB.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Adjustable fade effect</h4>

	<p>This effect can be used in two ways, depending on the setting of the
	Handy presets combo box:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>With this combo box set to None selected, you can set the other controls
		to produce fades which don't necessarily start and end at zero and 100
		percent of the original amplitude.</li>

		<li>The other options of the combo box produce fades with a variety of
		shapes, but which do start and end at either zero or 100 percent of
		the original amplitude.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The Adjustable fade effect dialog contains the following controls:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Fade Type combo box. The options Fade Up and Fade Down are
		linear fades.  For the S-Curve Up and S-Curve Down options, the rate
		of change of the gain varies through the fade: it starts at a small rate
		of change, increases to a maximum half the way though, and then decreases
		to a small at the end. You may find that the S-Curve option sounds better
		than the linear option.</li>

		<li>Mid-fade Adjust(%) edit box and slider. The default value of the edit
		box is zero percent, and the use of other values won't be described in
		this guide.</li>

		<li>Start/End as combo box. This specifies the units for the two edit boxes which
		follow the combo box. The options are % of Original and db gain.</li>
		
		<li>Start (or end) and End(or start) edit boxes. These two edit boxes
		should contain the values of the gain at the start and end of the fade.
		Note that the order of the two values doesn't matter. If the Fade Type
		combo box has been set to a fade down, then the higher of the two
		values will be used for the start of the fade, and the lower of the
		two values for the end of the fade. And similarly for a fade up.</li>

		<li>Handy presets combo box, which has the default value of None Selected.
		The other options are fades of various shapes. When one of these options
		is chosen, the settings of the previous controls are ignore, and the
		start and ends of the fade are either zero or 100 percent of the
		original amplitude.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As an example of the use of this effect, say that you want to fade down
	the audio in a track to 50 percent of the original, and then stay at that
	level till the end of the track.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Ensure that the track is selected, and no other tracks are selected.</li>

		<li>Select a time range for the initial fade down.</li>
		
		<li>Open the Adjustable fade effect. Set the Fade Type to
		either Fade down or S-Curve Down,  Start/End as to % of Original,
		and the following two edit boxes to 100 and 50 (or indeed 50 and 100).
		Press <strong>Enter</strong>. The fade is applied.</li>

		<li>The time range remains selected. Press <strong>Right arrow</strong>
		to deselect the time range and move the cursor to the right hand end
		of that time range. Select a time range from
		that point to the end of the audio in the track.</li>

		<li>Open the Adjustable fade effect. Set both the Start and End edit
		boxes to 50%, and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	 
		
	<h3 id="sync-lock-tracks">Sync lock tracks</h3>
	
	<p>The idea of sync-lock tracks is to try and keep a group of tracks time
	synchronized with each other when some operation, such as deleting, affects
	the timing of one or more tracks in the group.</p>
 
	<p>Say you just had two audio tracks, and they were sync-locked. If you select
	one track and a time range, and delete the selected audio, then the audio in that
	time range in the unselected track is also deleted, so that all the remaining audio
	in the two tracks is still in sync with each other. Similarly with just two tracks
	which are sync locked, then if you select one track, and paste some audio into that
	track at the cursor position, then silence, with the same duration as the pasted audio,
	is pasted into the unselected track at the cursor position.</p>
	
	<p>You switch sync lock tracks on and off in the tracks menu, and by default it's off.
	If there are only audio tracks in the project, then there's just one group of sync-locked
	tracks. The tracks in a project can be divided up into more than one group using label
	tracks. Each audio track which follows immediately after a label track starts a new group.</p>
		 
	<p>When you select one or more tracks in a sync locked group, then an appropriate icon
	is shown in the track for sighted users, and the phrase sync locked is added to the
	name of the track for screen reader users.</p>
	

	<h2 id="labels">Labels</h2>
	
	<p>A label represents either a specific time position or a specific time range, and it can
	have a name. A label representing
	a specific time is referred to as a point label, and a label representing a
	specific time range is referred to as a region label.</p>
	
	<p>Labels are stored in Label tracks. There can be more than one Label track in a project,
	but normally a single label track is all that is needed.</p>
	
	<p>You can label positions or time ranges as described in the next section,
	and then easily return to these later on in your editing using the commands
	described in the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#moving-to-labels">Moving to labels section</a>.
	In addition, a number of the tools on the Analyze menu add a label track to
	the project which contains their results. For example, the Find clipping tool produces
	a label track containing labels at points where the audio has clipped.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="creating-labels">Creating labels</h3>
	
	<p>There are two commands for creating labels, and both are on the Labels sub menu
	on the Edit menu:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Add Label at Selection (<strong>Ctrl + B</strong>). With no time range selected, this
		creates a point label for the position of the Cursor. If there is a selected
		time range, then it creates a region label for the time range.</li>
		
		<li>Add Label at Playback position (<strong>Ctrl + M</strong>), which creates
		a point label at the playback or recording position.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For these commands, there is an option as to whether any name for a new label
	is entered in a dialog box, or in an edit box in the label track. The second
	option is not very accessible for users of screen readers, and so it's recommended
	that you use the dialog box option. In the Preferences, in the Tracks Behaviors
	category, there is a Use dialog for the name of a new label check box,
	which is not checked by default, but which you can check.</p>
	
	<p>Using these commands for creating labels using both of these options will be described.
	First, using a dialog box for the name:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Either choose one of the commands from the Labels sub menu on the Edit
		menu, or press its shortcut. A New label dialog opens, and a name edit box
		is the initial focus.</li>

		<li>Type in a name for the label (optional), and then press <strong>Enter</strong>
		to press the OK button, which is the dialog's default button. The new
		label in added to a label track, which is the first of the following possibilities:
		the focussed track, if it's a label track; the first label track below this track,
		if such a track exists; a new label track appended to the existing tracks.
		The focus is returned to the original track.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>To use these commands for adding labels, not using the dialog option:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Either choose one of them from the Labels sub menu of the Edit menu, or press its keystroke.
		If the focused track isn't a label track, then the first label track below this
		track becomes the focused track, if such a track exists. If there isn't one,
		a new label track is appended to the existing tracks, and becomes the focused track.
		In the focused label track a new label is created, and an edit box is opened for entering
		a name for the label. Unfortunately your screen reader does not say that the focus is now this
		edit box.</li>
		
		<li>Type in a name for the label (optional), and then press <strong>Enter</strong>
		to close the edit box. For the Add label at Playback position command, the focus
		is then returned to the original track.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3 id="moving-to-labels">Moving to labels</h3>
	
	<p>There are two commands for moving to labels. For the purposes of working out which is the nearest
	label, the position of a region label is taken to be the start of its time range.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Move to next label (<strong>Alt + Right Arrow</strong>). This moves to the nearest label
		after the cursor, or the start of a selected time range. If there's no label after this time,
		then it wraps round to the first label.</li>
		
		<li>Move to previous label (<strong>Alt + Left Arrow</strong>). This moves to the nearest label
		before the cursor, or the start of a selected time range. If there's no label before this time,
		then it wraps round to the last label.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Both these commands use the labels in a single label track, not all the label tracks in the project.
	If there is a single label track in the project, which is the usual case, then the commands use that
	track whatever track is the focus. If there is more than one label track in the project, then if the
	focused track is a label track this track is used, otherwise the first label track below the focused
	track, if one exists, is used.</p>
	
	<p>When these commands move to a label: if the label is a point label, then the cursor
	is set to the label's position; if the label is a region label, then a time range is selected using
	the label's time range. In both cases, Jaws says the name of the label, if it has one, followed by its
	position in the label track. If these commands are used during playback, then playback continues
	using the label's cursor position or time range.</p>
	
	<p>Note that if a label track is the focus, then the keystrokes <strong>Tab</strong>, and
	<strong>Shift + Tab</strong> for moving to the next or previous label are also available. However
	use of these keystrokes is not recommended. In addition to moving to a label, these keystrokes
	also open the name of the label for editing in an edit box which is not read properly
	by screen readers. If you accidentally use one of these keystrokes, then you can close
	the edit box by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>. If you need to edit the name of a label,
	you can use the Edit labels dialog, which is described in the next section.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Editing labels</h3>
	
	<p>The uses of the Edit labels dialog include renaming a label, deleting a label, and as an
	alternative to the move to label commands. To open
	the dialog, open the Edit menu, open the Labels sub menu, and choose Edit Labels.
	The dialog includes the following controls:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A table which contains details the labels in all of the label
		tracks in the project, and which is described in the next section.</li>
		
		<li>Insert and Delete buttons which can be used for
		editing the table.</li>
		
		<li>Import and Export buttons for importing labels from and exporting labels to a text file.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When you open the dialog, one of the cells in the table is the focus and is selected. Assuming
	that the project contains at least one label, then one of the names of the
	labels is selected. In determining which name is selected, the position of a region label is taken
	as the start of its time range:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If the cursor, or the start of a selected time range is at the position of a label,
		then the name of that label is selected.</li>
		
		<li>Otherwise, the name of the label which is the nearest label before this time is selected.</li>
		
		<li>If there is no label before this time, then the name of the first label is selected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When you close the dialog, either by pressing OK or cancelling it, then either the cursor or a time range
	is set using the label which is selected in the table, depending on whether the selected label is a point
	label or a region label.</p>
		
	<p>Note that opening the dialog when there are no labels in the project is not
	recommended. If you do so the table contains a single row, and
	the name of a label track is the focus and is selected. The name of the label is blank. 
	If you press the OK button, then a new label track is appended to the tracks in the project,
	and this track contains a label with a blank name. The best thing
	to do if you open the dialog in this state is to press <strong>Esc</strong> to cancel it. However
	even if you cancel, the cursor is set to time zero, and so you loose the previous position
	of the cursor.</p>
	
	
	<h4>The table</h4>
	
	<p>The table has six columns: the name of the label track, name of the label,
	start and end times, and low and high frequencies. If a label is a point label,
	then the start and end time have the same value. The low and high frequencies
	are for spectral selection, and are not covered in this guide.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of ways of selecting a cell in the table:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To select the next cell in the table, press
		<strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Right Arrow</strong>. If the last
		cell is selected, pressing <strong>Tab</strong> moves you to the
		next control, which is the Add button.</li>
		
		<li>To select the previous cell in the table, press
		<strong>Shift + Tab</strong> or <strong>Left Arrow</strong>.
		If the first cell is selected, then pressing <strong>Shift + Tab</strong>
		moves you to the previous control which is the Cancel button at
		the bottom of the dialog.</li>
		
		<li>To select the cell directly below or above the current cell,
		press <strong>Down Arrow</strong> or <strong>Up Arrow</strong> respectively.</li>
		
		<li>To select the first or last cell, press <strong>Ctrl + Home</strong>
		or <strong>Ctrl + End</strong> respectively.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> Note that because <strong>Tab</strong> can be used for selecting a cell
	in the table, there are a couple of keystrokes which move you
	directly out of the table. From any cell in the table, <strong>Ctrl + tab</strong>,
	and <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Tab</strong> move to the next or previous control.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Deleting a label</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Select any of the cells in the row representing the label.</li>
		
		<li>There are then two alternatives. The first is to press <strong>Ctrl + Tab</strong>
		to move to the first control after the table, <strong>Tab</strong> to the Delete button
		and press it. The second is to make use of the Delete button's access key, and to simply
		press <strong>Alt + L</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h4>Editing cells</h4>
	
	<p>Screen readers read all the cells as if they were edit boxes. Just ignore this. None of the
	cells behave like standard edit boxes, and the way you edit a cell depends on the type
	of value it contains. The editing of the names of labels and the start and end times
	are described in the next two sections. In both cases you can confirm the edit by
	pressing <strong>Enter</strong> or <strong>Tab</strong>. The difference between
	the two is that <strong>Enter</strong> moves you the cell immediately below the current
	cell, and <strong>Tab</strong> moves you to the next cell. In addition, in both
	cases you can cancel the edit by pressing <strong>Esc</strong>.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Editing the name of the label</h4>
	
	<p>You can either overwrite or edit the current name:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To overwrite the current name, simply type in some text, and
		then press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong> to confirm the edit,
		or <strong>Esc</strong> to cancel the edit.</li>
		
		<li>To edit the existing name, press <strong>F2</strong>, which
		selects the existing text. To deselect the text before editing,
		press <strong>Right Arrow</strong> or <strong>End</strong>
		which positions the current
		character immediately after the existing text, or press
		<strong>Home</strong> which makes the current character
		the first character in the text. To confirm the edit press
		<strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong>, or to cancel the edit press
		<strong>Esc</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Editing the start or end time</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press <strong>F2</strong>. You can now edit the time in exactly
		the same way as you can edit the time controls such as Selection
		start in the Selection toolbar.</li>
		
		<li>To confirm the edit press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong>,
		or to cancel the edit press <strong>Esc</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Note that by default, the time format of the start and end times is the
	same as the time format of the time controls in the selection toolbar. You
	can temporarily change the time format by using the context menu
	of one the times when it is being edited. This changed format only
	applies to the time controls in the dialog, and the temporary change
	is not saved when then dialog is closed.</p>
	
	
	<h2 id="clips">Clips</h2>
	
	<p>In most of the rest of this guide, it has been assumed that an audio track contains
	a single section of audio data. However, an audio track can contain a number of
	separate sections, and these are referred to as clips. In Audacity, clips can not
	overlap.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of ways you can end up with more than one clip on a track:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>When you record with the audio being appended to an an existing track,
		then the recorded audio is added as a separate clip.</li>
		
		<li>The use of various split commands, which are described below.</li>
		
		<li>Paste some audio into a track which already contains a clip, and at a position
		which does not lie within the existing clip.</li>
	</ul>
	
		
	<h3>Moving the cursor</h3>

	<p>There are commands for moving both to the next and previous clip boundary,
	where a clip boundary is either the start or end of a clip.
	These commands appear on the Cursor to sub menu of the Transport menu.
	The command to move the cursor to the next clip boundary moves the cursor to the next
	clip boundary after the cursor, or the end of the selected time range. Similarly, the command
	to move the cursor to the previous clip boundary, moves the cursor to the previous
	clip boundary before the cursor, or the start of the selected time range.</p>
	
	<p>If any audio tracks are selected, then these commands find clip boundaries in
	these selected tracks. Otherwise, the commands find clip boundaries in all the audio tracks.</p>
	
	<p>When the cursor is moved to a clip boundary, your screen reader says either start or end, followed by
	the number of the clip, followed by the name of the track. In the case where two clips
	are immediately next to each other, and the clip boundary is both the end of one clip
	and the start of the next, then your screen reader says this.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Selecting a time range</h3>
	
	<p>There are two sets of commands for selecting time ranges which involve clip boundaries,
	and these are described in the next two sections. In both cases, if any audio tracks
	are selected, then the commands use the clips in the selected tracks. Otherwise,
	the commands use the clips in all the audio tracks.</p>

	
	<h4>Selecting the previous or next clip</h4>
	
	<p>There are commands for both selecting the previous clip, and selecting the
	the next clip. They can be found on the Clip Boundaries sub menu of the Select
	menu, and they have shortcuts <strong>Alt + Comma</strong>, and <strong>Alt + Period</strong>
	respectively. When a clip is selected, your screen reader says the number of the clip in the
	track, followed by the name of the track.</p>
	
	<p>Note that you can also easily use these commands for moving to clip boundaries.
	Just select the relevant clip, and then press <strong>Left Arrow</strong> or
	<strong>Right Arrow</strong> to deselect the selection, and position the cursor
	at either the start or the end of the clip respectively.</p>
	
	<p>For those that are interested, the precise rules for determining which
	clips are selected when these commands are used are as follows.</p>
	
	<p>For the Select next clip command:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no selected time range, then the first clip which starts
		either at or after the cursor position is selected.</li>
		
		<li>If there is a selected time range, then if the start of the selection is
		positioned at the start of the clip, and the end of the selection is before
		the end of the clip, then that clip is selected. Otherwise the first clip
		which starts after the start of the selection is selected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For the Select previous clip command:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no selected time range, the first clip
		which starts before the cursor is selected.</li>
		
		<li>If there is a time range selected, then if the start of the selection is
		positioned at the start of a clip, and the end of the selection is after
		the end of the clip, then that clip is selected. Otherwise, the first clip
		which starts before the start of the selection is selected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Selecting using clip boundaries</h4>
	
	<p>The two commands for selecting using clip boundaries can be used in more cases
	than the commands for selecting the next and previous clip which were described
	in the previous selection. They are also found on the Clip Boundaries sub menu
	on the Select menu, but they do not have keystrokes assigned to them by default.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Previous Clip Boundary to Cursor, sets the start of the selected time range
		to the previous clip boundary.</li>
		
		<li>Cursor to Next Clip Boundary, sets the end of the selected time range
		to the next clip boundary.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When the start or the end of the selected time range is set to a clip boundary
	using these commands, your screen reader gives the details of the clip boundary, in exactly
	the same way as when the commands for moving the cursor to a clip boundary are used.</p>


	<h3>Various split commands</h3>
		
	<h4>Split</h4>
	
	<p>To split a clip into two clips in a selected track:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Position the cursor where you want to split the clip.</li>
		
		<li>On the Edit menu, open the Split Boundaries sub menu, and choose Split.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>You can also split a clip into three parts using this method, if you select a time range
	which lies within the clip.
	</p>
	
	
	<h4>Split delete, and Split cut</h4>
	
	<p>You can use the split delete and split cut commands to delete or cut the selected audio,
	without affecting the position of the contents of the track after the audio which was
	deleted or cut. This is in contrast to the standard
	cut and delete commands, which do cause subsequent contents to move. These two split commands
	can be found on the Remove Special sub menu of the Edit menu.</p>
	
	<p>The effect of the split delete command is as follows. For each track which is selected,
	any audio data in the selected time range is
	removed, leaving an empty track in that time range, and so the position of
	any subsequent audio data in the track is left unchanged.</p>
	
	<p>For example, if in a selected track, the selected time range lies within a a clip, this
	clip is split into two clips. The first clip ends at the start of the selected time
	range. There is then a section of empty track, which is the length of the time range,
	and then the second clip starts at the end of the time range.</p>
	
	<p>As another example, if the start of the selected time range lies within the clip, and the
	end of the time range is at the end of the clip, then the clip is shortened  no
	new clips are created.</p>
	
	<p>The effect of the split cut command is the same as the split delete command, except that
	the audio that is removed is placed on the clipboard, rather than just being deleted.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Split New</h4>
	
	<p>The Split New command can be found on the Clip Boundaries sub menu of the Edit menu.
	This command moves the selected audio to a new track or tracks, without affecting the
	position of any subsequent audio in the original track.</p>
	
	<p>For each track which is selected, any audio data in the selected time range is removed,
	leaving an empty track in that time range, and so the position of the any
	subsequent audio data in the track is left unchanged. A new track is added after the
	last track, and the removed audio is pasted into this track at its original position.</p>
	
	<p>You can think of Split new as being equivalent to Split cut, followed by the cut audio
	being pasted into a new track at the same position as the original selected audio.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Detach at silences</h4>
	
	<p>If the selected audio contains sections of complete silence, that is the amplitude of the
	audio is zero, then the Detach at Silences command can be used remove those
	sections of audio, leaving clips which are separated from each other by the
	resulting sections of empty track. The command can be found on the Clip Boundaries sub
	menu of the Edit menu.</p>
	
	<p>For each section in the selected audio where the amplitude of the audio is
	zero, the audio data is removed, resulting in a section of empty track,
	and the position of any subsequent audio data in the track is left unchanged.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Merging clips</h3>
	
	<p>To merge two or more adjacent clips in a selected track:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Select a time range such that the start of the time range is before the end of the first clip,
		and the end of the time range is after the start of the last clip. So for example, you could
		arrange for the start of the time range to be the start of the first clip, and the end of the time
		range to be the end of the last clip.</li>
		
		<li>On the Edit menu, open the Clip Boundaries sub menu, and choose Join (<strong>Ctrl+J</strong>).
		The clips are joined together, and any space between the clips is replaced by silence.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="time-shifting-clips">Time shifting clips</h3>
	
	<p>There are a couple of commands, Time Shift Left and Time Shift Right, which can be used to move
	either a single clip, or a number of clips. The Extra menu contains an edit sub menu, which contains
	these commands. For information about this Extra menu, see the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#extra-menu">Extra menu section</a> of the Preferences section. By default no
	shortcuts are assigned to these commands, but if you use these commands frequently,
	you'll probably want to assign your own keystrokes.</p>
	
	<p>The Time Shift Left and Time Shift Right Commands move the clip or clips by a small amount to
	the left or right respectively. As in the case of using the arrow keys to move the cursor,
	the amount of movement depends on the Zoom setting, and the step size can be adjusted,
	as described in the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#step-size">Step size of the left and right arrow keys section</a>
	of the Moving the Cursor section.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Moving a single clip</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move to the track which contains the clip which you want to move.</li>
		
		<li>Move the cursor so that it lies anywhere within the clip. If the cursor is at either the
			start or end of clip, then it it is considered to be lie within the clip,
			but it's not recommended to use the end of the clip for reasons which
			are explained below.
		</li>
		
		<li>Time Shift Left or Time Shift Right move both the clip and the cursor by a small amount. If the
		clip can not be moved, because it is immediately next to another clip, then your screen reader says
		clip can not be moved</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>If the cursor is positioned at a clip boundary which is both the end of one clip and the
	start of the next clip, then for the purposes of moving clips, the cursor is considered
	to be within the second clip, and this is the clip which the commands use. Because
	of this, when you are placing the cursor within a clip to move it, it's recommended
	that you don't position the cursor at the end of the clip. If the cursor is at the end
	of a clip, then if you repeatedly use the Clip right command and the clip becomes
	immediately adjacent to the next clip, then the cursor will then be considered
	to lie within the next clip, and it is this clip, rather than the original clip
	that will move. This is unlikely to be what you want.</p>
	

	<h4>Moving a number of adjacent clips</h4>
	
	<p>To move a number of adjacent clips in a track:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move to the track which contains the clips which you want to move.</li>
		
		<li>Select the track  the other tracks should not be selected.</li>
		
		<li>You then need to select a time range such that the start of the selection lies within
		the first clip you want to move, and the end of the selection lies within the last clip.
		So, for example you could move the cursor to the start of the first clip, and then
		set the end of the selection to the end of the last clip.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>In the case where other tracks are selected, in addition to the focused track, then in these
	tracks, all clips which include selected audio are also moved.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Moving clips when Sync lock tracks is enabled</h4>
	
	<p>The use of sync-lock tracks to keeps a group of tracks time synchronized was described
	in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#sync-lock-tracks">Sync lock tracks section</a>, which in the Editing when
	there are multiple tracks section. If sync lock tracks is enabled when you move either a single clip
	or a group of clips, then additional clips may be moved. We will refer
	to the clips that would be moved if sync lock tracks was disabled, as the original
	set of clips to be moved.</p>	

	<p>If a clip overlaps in time with a clip in the original set of clips to
	be moved, then it also will be moved.
	In fact, the rule is more general than this. For any clip, if there exists a series of
	clips, starting with this clip and ending with a clip in the original set of clips
	to be moved such that
	each pair of adjacent clips in this series overlap in time, then that clip will
	also be moved.</p>
		

	
	
	<h2 id="metadata-tags-editor">Metadata tags editor</h2>
	
	<p>Metadata is data which describes other data, and the
	metadata for audio files consists of a number of tags,
	where each tag is made up of a tag name and a tag value. The Metadata
	tags editor in Audacity allows you both to edit the values of a number
	of preset tags, and also to create your own custom tags.</p>
	
	<p>You can open the Edit Metadata Tags dialog at any time by choosing
	Metadata from the Edit menu. In addition, if you save audio
	in one of the standard formats, then unless you've turned the
	appropriate option off, the Edit Metadata Tags dialog
	automatically opens, as described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#saving-audio">Saving audio section</a> above.</p>
	
	<p>The Edit Metadata Tags dialog contains the following controls:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A table which contains the names and values of the tags,
		and is described in the next section.</li>
		
		<li>Add, Remove, and Clear buttons which are used for editing the
		table. Pressing the Clear button deletes all the values
		of the preset tags, and all names and values of any custom tags.
		The Add and Remove buttons are described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#creating-and-editing-custom-tags">creating and editing custom tags</a> section.</li>
		
		<li>A genres section, consisting of Edit and Reset buttons which
		are used for editing the preset list of genres, as described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#editing-the-list-of-genres">Editing the list of genres section</a>
		below.</li>
		
		<li>A template section, which won't be described in this guide.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>The table</h3>
	
	<p>The table has two columns: Tag and Value, and the
	first 7 cells in the Tag column contain preset tag names
	such as Artist Name and Track Title. Your screen reader indicates that these preset
	tag names are not editable by saying unavailable or disabled after their names.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of ways of selecting a cell in the table:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To select the next cell in the table, press
		<strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Right Arrow</strong>. If the last
		cell is selected, pressing <strong>Tab</strong> moves you to the
		next control, which is the Add button.</li>
		
		<li>To select the previous cell in the table, press
		<strong>Shift + Tab</strong> or <strong>Left Arrow</strong>.
		If the first cell is selected, then pressing <strong>Shift + Tab</strong>
		move you to the previous control which is the Cancel button at
		the bottom of the dialog.</li>
		
		<li>To select the cell directly below or above the current cell,
		press <strong>Down Arrow</strong> or <strong>Up Arrow</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To select the first or last cell, press <strong>Ctrl + Home</strong>
		or <strong>Ctrl + End</strong> respectively.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> Note that because <strong>Tab</strong> can be used for selecting a cell
	in the table, there are a couple of keystrokes which move you
	directly out of the table. From any cell in the table, <strong>Ctrl + tab</strong>,
	and <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Tab</strong> move to the next or previous control.</p>

	
	<h3>Editing tag values</h3>
	
	<p>All the tag values except the genre tag value are edited using
	an edit box, but the genre tag value is edited with an edit combo
	box, which allows you to quickly choose from a list of genres.</p>
	
	<p>To edit any tag value, except the genre tag value,
	there are two options: either overwriting or editing the current value,
	as described below.
	Both involve using the keystrokes <strong>Enter</strong> or
	<strong>Tab</strong> to confirm the edit. <strong>Enter</strong> selects
	the cell immediately below the current cell, and
	<strong>Tab</strong> selects the next cell, which is the tag
	name in the next row.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To overwrite the current value, simply type in some text, and
		then press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong> to confirm the edit,
		or <strong>Esc</strong> to cancel the edit.</li>
		
		<li>To edit the existing value, press <strong>F2</strong>, which
		selects the existing text. To deselect the text before editing,
		press <strong>Right Arrow</strong> or <strong>End</strong>
		which positions the current
		character immediately after the existing text, or press
		<strong>Home</strong> which makes the current character
		the first character in the text. To confirm the edit press
		<strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong>, or to cancel the edit press
		<strong>Esc</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>To edit the genre tag value:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>As in the case of other tag values, you can start the edit
		either by just starting to type, or by pressing <strong>F2</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>You can use the <strong>Up Arrow</strong> and <strong>Down Arrow</strong>
		keys to select a genre from the preset list of genres. To quickly
		find a genre beginning with a given letter, type this letter,
		and then press <strong>Down Arrow</strong> to move through all
		the genres beginning with that letter.</li>
		
		<li>To confirm the edit press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong>, and to
		cancel the edit press <strong>Esc</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="creating-and-editing-custom-tags">Creating and editing custom tags</h3>
	
	<p>You can use the rows in the table after the preset tags to create
	your own custom tags. In these rows you can edit both the tag
	name and the tag value.</p>
	
	<p>For a new set of metadata, there's one spare row after the
	preset tags. You can add and remove rows from the table using
	the Add and Remove buttons which follow the table. The
	Add button appends a row, and the Remove button removes the current
	custom row.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="editing-the-list-of-genres">Editing the list of genres</h3>
	
	<p>To edit the list of genres which is available in the edit-combo
	box when you edit the genre value:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press the Edit button in the Genres section.</li>
		
		<li>An Edit Genres dialog opens. The first control is a multi-line
		edit box which contains the genres, one genre on each line.
		Note that when you first open the dialog, all the genres are
		selected, so unless you type a text navigation keystroke first,
		for example <strong>Right Arrow</strong>, you'll overwrite all
		the genres. To move to the top or bottom of the list press
		<strong>Ctrl + Home</strong> or <strong>Ctrl + End</strong>
		respectively.</li>
		
		<li>When you've finished editing, <strong>Tab</strong> to the
		OK button and press it.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>To reset the list of genres to the default list of genres,
	press the Reset button in the Genres section. A Reset Genres
	message box opens, asking you whether you're sure that you want
	to reset the list. Press <strong>Enter</strong> to press the
	default OK button.</p>
	
	

	
	
	<h2 id="recording">Recording</h2>
	
	<p>The next three sections on settings, recording commands and keystrokes, and
	adjusting the recording level cover material which is relevant to
	nearly all recording. After that there are sections on punch and roll recording,
	and latency compensation. The latter describes how Audacity can correct for the
	delay in the recorded audio when recording a
	vocal track whilst listening to existing tracks.</p>
	

	<h3 id="recording-settings">Recording settings</h3>
	
	<p>There are a number of settings which may need changing before
	you make a recording, and they're described in the following sections. Note
	that a number of these settings can be made either in the Devices category
	of the Preferences dialog, or an individual dialog, or the Device Toolbar.</p>
    
    
	<h4 id="audio-interface">Audio interface</h4>
    
    <p>Audacity provides a number of options for the software interface which
    Audacity uses to interact with the playback and recording devices:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>MME (Multimedia extensions). This is the default interface.</li>
        
        <li>Windows DirectSound. Normally there are no advantages in using this
		compared to using the MME interface.</li>
        
        <li>Windows WASAPI (Windows audio session API).
		When using this interface, the recording
		devices also include the so called loopback versions of
        the playback devices. Using these, you can record the audio which is
        sent to one of these playback devices. This offers an alternative to
        the stereo mix recording device which may or may not be
        provided by your sound card.</li>
    </ul>
	
	<p>You can set this option using either the Interface host combo box in
	the Devices category of the Preferences dialog, or the Audio host
	combo box in the Select Audio Host dialog (<strong>Shift + H</strong>),
	or the Audio Host combo box on the Device toolbar. Note that when you
	change this option, the settings of the recording and playback devices may
	change, and so you should check these settings.</p>


	<h4>Recording device</h4>
	
    <p>You can select the recording device using either the recording device
    combo box in the Devices category in the Preferences dialog, or the recording
	device combo box in the Select Recording Device dialog (<strong>Shift + I</strong>),
	or the recording device combo box on the Device toolbar.</p>
	
	<p>If you're using either the MME or the DirectSound audio interface, then the
	available devices may also include either Microsoft Sound Mapper - Input
	or Primary Sound Captive Driver, respectively. Both of these correspond to
	the device which has been set as the default recording device in Windows.
	Generally, using one of these options isn't recommended, as the default recording
	device can sometimes change unexpectedly, and so change your recording device
	in Audacity without any warning.</p>
	
	<p>These combo boxes list all the recording devices
	which were plugged in and enabled when audacity was opened. If a device
	isn't listed, then check the Recording
	page of Windows Sound dialog to see if the device is enabled. This
	dialog is described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#sound-dialog-in-windows">Sound dialog in Windows  section</a>, for those
	unfamiliar with this dialog.</p>
	
	
	<h4 id="recording-level">Recording level</h4>
	
	<p>This section describes which control to use to adjust the recording level. How to adjust
	the recording level so that you don't get too much noise or clipping is described in the
    <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#adjusting-the-recording-level">Adjusting the recording level section</a>
    below.</p>
    
    <p>If Audacity can control the level of the recording device, then you can
    use either Audacity's recording volume slider, or the appropriate Windows control.
    It's normally easier to use the recording volume slider in Audacity,
    which is in the Mixer toolbar in the Upper toolbars section
    of Audacity's main window. To move to it from the Track view table, press
    <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> twice, and then <strong>Tab</strong> or
    <strong>Shift + Tab</strong> until you get to the recording volume slider.</p>
    
    <p>When Audacity can't control the level of the recording device, this
    is indicated by the recording volume slider being unavailable.
	For sighted users, the slider appears greyed out, and for users of
	screen readers, you can't Tab to it. In these cases you have to use the appropriate
	control which is part of Windows, as described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#sound-dialog-in-windows">Sound dialog in Windows section</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Whether Audacity can control the recording level depends to a large extent on
    the audio interface which you are using:</p>
        
    <ul>
        <li>MME or Direct Sound. For many recording devices, you can use
        Audacity's recording volume slider.</li>
		
        <li>WASAPI. For the loopback devices provided by the WASAPI interface,
        the recording level depends only on the volume levels set in the programs
        which are sending their output to the playback device which you're recording.
        It doesn't depend on the Windows volume of the playback device,
        or the recording and playback volume sliders in Audacity.</li>
    </ul>

	
	
	<h4>Number of recording channels</h4>
	
	<p>The number of channels of the recording device can be set using either
	the recording channels combo box in the Devices category of the Preferences
	dialog, or the recording channels combo box in the Select Recording Channels
	dialog (<strong>Shift + N</strong>), or the Recording Channels combo box in
	the Device toolbar. If you're recording using a microphone, then the
	appropriate setting depends whether it's a mono or stereo microphone.
	If you're recording from line in, stereo mix, or one of the loopback devices
	when using WASAPI, then the setting should be stereo.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Overdub option</h4>
	
    <p>The Overdub option controls whether Audacity plays any
    existing tracks while recording a new one. You can check or
    uncheck this option either on the Transport Options sub menu on the Transport menu,
	or in the Recording category of the Preferences dialog.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Software Playthrough option</h4>
	
    <p>The Software Playthrough option controls whether Audacity
    plays the new track while it is being recorded. Normally this
    option should be off, but it's useful if you want to hear what
    you're recording from a device such a USB turntable. It can
    be checked or unchecked either on the Transport Options sub menu on the Transport menu,
	or in the Recording category of the Preferences dialog.</p>	
	
	
	<h3 id="recording-commands-and-keystrokes">Recording commands and keystrokes</h3>
	
	<p>The recording commands and keystrokes, using default settings are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To start recording, either press <strong>R</strong>, or on the Transport menu,
		open the Recording sub menu, and choose Record. If the project contains
		no audio tracks, then a new audio track is created, and the recorded audio is inserted
		into this track, which is initially not selected.
		If there are existing audio tracks, then the recorded audio is appended
		to the first selected audio track, if any are selected, or else the first
		audio track.</li>
		
		<li>To start recording, with the recorded audio always inserted into
		a new track, either press <strong>Shift + R</strong> or on the Transport menu,
		open the Recording sub menu, and choose Record New Track. A new track is
		automatically added to the project, and
		the recorded audio is inserted at the cursor position. The new track is initially
		not selected.</li>

		<li>To start punch and roll recording, press <strong>Shift + D</strong>,
		or on the Transport menu, open the Recording sub menu, and choose Punch
		and Roll Record. This can be used for easily correcting mistakes
		which you've just make, and is described in the
		<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#punch-and-roll-recording">Punch and roll recording</a>
		section below.</li>
	
		<li>To pause or resume recording, press <strong>P</strong>.</li>

		<li>To stop recording, press <strong>Spacebar</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Note that during a recording, the second section of the status bar contains
	the maximum length of recording you can make given your free disk space.</p>

	<p>In the versions of Audacity 2.1.3 and earlier, the shortcuts
	<strong>R</strong> and <strong>Shift + R</strong> for
	two of the commands to start recording were the other way round. There's an option
	in Preferences which easily allows you to have them that way round if you
	find it more convenient. In the Recording category of Preferences,
	there is an Record on a new track check box, which is not checked
	by default. If this check box is checked then the two commands to start recording are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To start recording with the recorded audio inserted into a new track,
		either press <strong>R</strong>, or on the Transport menu, open the Recording
		sub menu, and choose Record.</li>
		
		<li>To Start recording, with the recorded audio appended to the audio in
		an existing track, either press <strong>Shift + R</strong>, or on the Transport menu,
		open the Recording sub menu, and choose Append Record.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="adjusting-the-recording-level">Adjusting the recording level</h3>
	
	<p>There is a Recording meter in the Upper toolbars section of the Audacity window
	for helping to set up the recording level. The meter contains a Record meter
	drop down button, and you can move to this button by pressing <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong>
	twice to move to the Upper toolbars, and then pressing <strong>Tab</strong> until you get to it.</p>
	
	<p>If you press this button by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>, then a menu opens
	which contains commands for controlling the meter. You can start and stop monitoring
	using this menu, and the meter also automatically monitors the input
	signal during recording. To make the meter accessible for screen reader users, the
	following information is included in the name of the drop down button
	which is read out by screen readers:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The peak level. This is the maximum amplitude during the monitoring session,
		and it is automatically reset when monitoring starts. By default, this
		is given in decibels, with 0 being the maximum value.</li>
		
		<li>The word monitoring, if monitoring is in progress.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>To check what the peak level of a recording is roughly likely to be with current setting
	of the recording level:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Press the record meter drop down button, and choose Start monitoring.</li>
		
		<li>Make some representative sounds for a short while.</li>
		
		<li>Press the record meter drop down button, and choose Stop monitoring. The
		name of the drop down button includes the peak level of this monitoring
		session.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Normally a good value of the peak level to aim for is about -6db. This should ensure
	that the recording level is both low enough so that distortion or clipping doesn't occur,
	and high enough so that you don't get an unnecessary amount of noise.</p>

	<p>At any time when the meter is monitoring, you can read the peak level
	that has occurred so far in that monitoring session, but how to do this depends
	on which screen reader you're using. If you are using either NVDA or Narrator,
	you can read the peak level by pressing the keystroke to read the current line.
	However, if you're using Jaws, to have to tab away and then tab back to the
	meter button.</p>

	<p>The peak level can also be given using a linear scale of 0 to 1. You'll
	probably want to just stick with decibels, but if you want to change the scale:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Press the record meter drop down button by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>Choose Options. The Recording Meter Options dialog opens.</li>
		
		<li>Set the Meter Type radio buttons to dB or linear.</li>
	</ol>



	<h3 id="punch-and-roll-recording">Punch and roll recording</h3>

	<p>Punch and roll recording allows you to easily correct a recording just after you've made a mistake.</p>
	
	<p>Punch recording in is a term used for overwriting part of a recorded track when you're
	playing back the track. The punch in point is the time at which the audio editor switches
	from playback to recording over existing audio. And similarly, any punch out point is the
	time at which the audio editor stops recording and reverts to playback. In punch
	and roll recording, there is a punch in point, but no punch out point. The recording
	continues until you stop it.</p>

	<p>The following is an outline of Punch and roll recording in Audacity:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>You are recording, and realize that you've just made a mistake. Stop the recording.</li>

		<li>Position the cursor where you want the punch in point. This will usually be shortly
		before the end of the recording, and during a pause, for example the pause between
		sentences.</li>

		<li>Start punch and roll recording. Playback starts from a few seconds before the punch-in
		point. Once the punch-in point is reached, playback stops and recording starts.
		The recording continues until you stop it.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Using Punch and roll record, you base the timing of the new recording on listening to
	the playback of the audio before the punch in point. However, within Audacity there is a delay
	between the played and the recorded audio. There is a default compensation for this,
	and this may be good enough. However, if the timing of the audio near the punch in
	point doesn't sound right, indicating that the compensation is not good enough,
	then see the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#latency-compensation">Latency compensation section</a> below for more
	details of this delay, and how to adjust its compensation.</p>

	<p>A more detailed description of punch and roll recording is as follows.
	You are recording, and realize that you've just made a mistake. Stop
	the recording by pressing either <strong>Spacebar</strong> or <strong>X</strong>.</p>

	<p>You now need to move the cursor to the position of the punch in point:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If you haven't already done so, check that the track is selected,
		and that any other tracks are not selected.</li>

		<li>If you stopped the recording by pressing <strong>Spacebar</strong>, then press
		<strong>K</strong> to move to the end of the audio. If you
		stopped the recording by pressing <strong>X</strong>, then the cursor will already
		be at the end of the audio. In fact it will be slightly after the end,
		but this doesn't matter.</li>

		<li>One way of then moving the cursor back to a suitable punch in point
		is as follows. First move the cursor to a little before the intended
		punch in point using the <strong>Comma</strong> or
		<strong>Shift + Comma</strong> to move the cursor to the left by a short
		or long time respectively. Then start playback, and press X when you
		reach the intended punch in point. Playback stops, and the cursor is
		positioned at the point where playback stopped.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>After you have positioned the cursor, then on the Transport menu,
	open the Recording sub menu, and choose Punch and Roll Record (<strong>Shift + D</strong>).
	This command causes the following to happen:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The audio after the cursor in the selected track is deleted.</li>

		<li>The pre-roll playback starts a few seconds before the cursor. The
		pre roll is 5 seconds by default, but you can set whatever value you
		want in the recording category of the Preferences dialog. During
		this playback you may find it useful to perform along to the
		existing recording, so that don't have to start from cold when
		the recording starts.</li>

		<li>When the playback reaches the cursor, playback stops and recording starts.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>After a punch and roll record:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If you've made a mistake in roughly the same place again, you can just do
		another punch and roll record, leaving the cursor at the original punch in position.</li>

		<li>You can undo the punch and roll by pressing <strong>Ctrl + Z</strong></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Immediately after the punch in point, Audacity applies a short crossfade
	from the original audio to the newly recorded audio. This is to avoid introducing
	any glitches. The default length of the crossfade is 10ms, which will probably be
	a suitable value, but you can change this value in the recording category of the
	Preferences dialog.</p>

	
	<h3 id="latency-compensation">Latency compensation</h3>
	
	<p>If you record a vocal track whilst listening to one or more existing tracks,
	then due to various delays, the newly recorded track won't be in
	sync with the original tracks. The total delay is known as the
	latency and some of the factors which affect its size are:
	the recording and playback devices, the size of the audio buffers
	within Audacity, and the audio interface being used (for example, MME or
	DirectSound).</p>
	
	<p>Audacity can automatically compensate for the latency, once the
	latency has been measured, as described below. In the
	Preferences dialog, in the Devices category, in the Latency group, there's a
	Latency compensation edit box, where the units of the compensation
	are milliseconds. If you record audio in a new track, then
	the audio is automatically moved later in time by this latency
	compensation. So to shift the audio earlier in time to offset the
	latency, the number should be negative.</p>
	
	<p>The default value of the latency compensation is -130 milliseconds.
    The default value will be only roughly correct for a particular recording
	set up, and it's recommended that you measure the actual latency.</p>
	
	<p>The following method for measuring the latency when using
	a microphone for recording is accurate to about 10ms, which normally
	should be good enough. It consists of the following three parts,
	which will be described in detail in the following sections:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Generate a rhythm track, which consists of a series of
		clicks with 1 second spacing.</li>
		
		<li>Record this rhythm track. Due to latency and its current
		compensation, the clicks in the recorded track may occur before
		or after the clicks in the original track.</li>
		
		<li>With the help of the Start of selection spin box in the
		Selection toolbar, find the position of the click in the recorded track
		which corresponds to the click at 1 second in the generated track,
		and work out a new compensation.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h4>Generate a rhythm track</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Choose Rhythm Track from the Generate menu.</li>
		
		<li>The second control is the Tempo [beats per minute] edit
		box, and its default value is 120. Type 60, and then
		press <strong>Tab</strong> twice to move to the next edit
		box.</li>
		
		<li>The Beats per measure [bar] edit box has a default value
		of 4. Type in the number 1, and then press <strong>Enter</strong>
		to press the default OK button.</li>
		
		<li>The rhythm track is created. The track is initially selected,
		and a time range is selected which includes all the audio.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h4>Record the rhythm track</h4>
	
	<p>To record the rhythm track being played back through your headphones,
	you'll obviously need to take them off temporarily. If you're using
	a separate microphone, rather than a headset microphone, then position
	it close to the headphones so that it can pick up the clicks.
	Start recording in a new track (<strong>Shift + R</strong>, by default), and then press
	<strong>Spacebar</strong> to stop the recording after a handful
	of clicks.</p>
	
	<p>With the first track still being the focus, press 
	<strong>Shift + U</strong> to mute it, and then playback the
	recorded track. If the clicks are very quiet
	compared to your screen reader, then amplify the track:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Deselect the first track, and select the second track</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Home</strong>, then <strong>Shift + End</strong>
		to select a time range.</li>
		
		<li>Choose Amplify from the effects menu.</li>
		
		<li>In the Amplify dialog, just press <strong>Enter</strong>
		to accept the default amplification.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h4>Find the position of a click in the recorded track</h4>
	
	<p>The following instructions describe how to find the position
	of the recorded click which corresponds to the click which occurs
	at 1 second in the generated track, and then update Audacity's
	latency compensation. It's assumed that the original track is still
	muted from when you checked the level of the recorded track above.</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press <strong>Home</strong> to set both the selection
		start and selection end/length spin boxes in the selection toolbar
		to zero.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the selection
		bar. <strong>Tab</strong> to the Show combo box, and
		make sure that the Start and Length of selection option is selected.</li>	
		
		<li>Then <strong>Tab</strong> to the Start spin box,
		and  change the format to hh:mm:ss + milliseconds using
		its context menu.</li>
		
		<li>To set the selection start to 1 second, press <strong>End</strong>
		to move to the last digit (milliseconds), press
		<strong>Left Arrow</strong> three to move to the seconds
		digit, and then press <strong>Up Arrow</strong> to increment it to one.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> to listen to the first few clicks.
		There are two cases: if the recorded click is later than the
		original click at 1 second, then time to the first click is much less than
		the one second spacing of the remaining clicks; if the recorded click
		is earlier than original click, then the time
		to the first click is roughly the same as the one second spacing
		between the remaining clicks. Finding the position of the recorded
		click, and modifying Audacity's latency compensation is described for
		these two cases in the following steps.</li>
		
		<li>To find the position of the recorded click when it's later
		than the original click, move to the 10 millisecond digit by
		pressing <strong>End</strong> to move to the last digit, and then
		pressing <strong>Left Arrow</strong>. Then go round the loop of incrementing the
		selection start by 10 milliseconds by pressing <strong>Up Arrow</strong> and then pressing
		<strong>Spacebar</strong> to check the time to the first click.
		When you've just gone past the click, the time to the first click will suddenly change
		to roughly a second. Decrement the selection start by 10 milliseconds
		so that you can still hear the first click almost immediately,
		and then press you screen reader's keystroke to read the current line,
		and so read the
		number of milliseconds. Adjust the latency compensation by subtracting
		this number from it. For example, if the initial compensation was
		-130ms, and the recorded click was 40ms late, then the latency
		compensation should be changed to -170ms.</li>
		
		<li>To find the position of the recorded click when it's earlier
		than the original click, move to the 10 millisecond digit by
		pressing <strong>End</strong> to move to the last digit, and then
		pressing <strong>Left Arrow</strong>. Then go round the loop of decrementing the
		selection start by 10 milliseconds by pressing <strong>Down Arrow</strong>, and then pressing
		<strong>Spacebar</strong> to check the time to the first click.
		When you move to just before the click, or during it, the click
		will suddenly sound immediately after the start of playback. Press you screen
		reader's keystroke to read the current line, and so read the
		number of milliseconds. Subtract this number from
		1000 to get the number of milliseconds by which the recorded click
		was early. Then adjust the latency compensation by adding this
		number to it. For example, if the initial compensation was -130ms
		and the recorded click was 20ms early, then the latency compensation
		should be changed to -110ms.</li>
	</ol>
    
    
	
	<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
	
	<p>The Audacity Preferences dialog allows you to adjust many
	of the settings in Audacity. After a brief description of the
	dialog box, the following sections describe some of the more
	common settings.</p>

	<h3>Audacity Preferences dialog box</h3>

	<p>To open this dialog box, choose Preferences on the Edit menu
	(<strong>Ctrl + P</strong>).</p>

	<p>On the left hand side of the dialog is a tree view which contains
	various categories. To the right of this tree view are controls
	for setting the options which correspond to the category which is selected
	in the tree view. So, once you've selected the category which you are
	interested in, you can then <strong>Tab</strong> through the settings
	for that category. The dialog's default button is the OK button.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="extra-menu">Extra menu</h3>

	<p>The Extra menu, which is not shown by default, contains commands which
	are not shown in the standard menus. It includes commands associated
	with the toolbars.</p>
	
	<p>You can change whether or not this menu is shown either by using the
	Extra menus option in the View menu, or by using a setting in Preferences:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Interface category.</li>
		
		<li>In the Options group, there is a Show Extra Menus check box, which
		by default is unchecked.</li>
	</ol>
	

	<h3 id="seek-times">Seek times</h3>

	<p>Whilst playing, you can jump (seek) forward or backward by either
	a short or long period. The default values of these periods are
	1 and 15 seconds respectively, but you can set them to whatever you want.
	These settings are shared by the commands for moving the cursor by a
	short or long period. To set the values of these periods:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Playback category.</li>

		<li>The Seek Time when playing group contains two edit boxes:
		Short period and Long period.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3 id="auto-select">Automatic selection</h3>

	<p>The is a select all audio option, which is off by default, and for users
	of screen readers it's recommended that this option is left off. This option causes tracks
	and/or time ranges to be selected with no audio feedback, and so can be
	confusing.</p>

	<p>The select all audio option effects what happens in two situations.
	The first is if you try to perform some action on some audio, for example apply
	an effect, and in fact no audio is selected. Remember that for
	for some audio to be selected, both one or more audio tracks have to
	be selected, and a time range has to be selected. If the option is off,
	then the result of the action is that
	a dialog opens, telling you that no audio is selected. If the option
	is on, then all the audio is the project is selected, and the action is
	performed.</p>

	<p>The second situation is if you try and perform some action on some
	tracks, for example to align them end to end, and in fact
	no tracks are selected. If the option is off, then the result of the
	action is that a dialog opens, telling you than one or more tracks
	need to be selected. If the option is on, then all the audio tracks
	in the project are selected, and the action is performed.</p>
	
	<p>To change this setting:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Tracks Behaviors category.</li>

		<li>In the behaviors group, there is a Select all audio, if section required
		check box, which is unchecked by default.</li>
	</ol> 
	
		
	<h3 id="ffmpeg-library">FFmpeg library</h3>
	
	<p>The FFmpeg library contains decoders and encoders which enable
	Audacity to open and save files in formats which are not
	supported by the standard installation of Audacity. The FFmpeg
	library is not included with Audacity due to legal issues
	about patents. Nearly all encoders are covered by one or more
	patents, but these patents aren't recognized in all countries. The
	<a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html">FFmpeg License and Legal Considerations page</a>
	of the FFmpeg website contains a few comments on these issues.</p>

	<p>Depending on whether you're using the 64 bit or the 32 bit version of Audacity,
	you'll need to install either the 64 bit or the 32 bit version of the
	FFmeg library respectively. You can check whether  you're using a 64 bit
	or 32 bit version of Audacity by reading the build information: on the
	Help menu, choose About, and in the About dialog move to the build information
	page. Included in the information is the build type. For 64 bit Audacity
	this will be CMake Release build (debug level 1), 64 bits,
	and for 32 bit Audacity, just CMake Release build (debug level 1).
	Instructions for downloading and installing the two versions of
	the FFmpeg library are given in the next two sections. There
	are no issues with having both versions installed at the same time.</p>


	<h4>FFmpeg library for 64 bit version of Audacity</h4>

	<p>To download and install the FFmpeg library:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the website whose address is
		<a href="https://lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg64audacity.php">lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg64audacity.php</a> .</li>
		
		<li>On this page, find the link FFmpeg v2.2.2 INSTALLER (.EXE), and then open it to download
		a file  which has the same name as the link. Note that if the link on the page is
		to a version later than 2.2.2 then that will be OK too.</li>
		
		<li>Open the downloaded file, and a setup wizard opens. The
		default location for the FFmpeg library is a newly created
		FFmpeg for Audacity folder in the Program Files folder.</li> 
	</ol>

	<p>Then, the next time Audacity is opened, it automatically finds the
	FFmpeg library.</p>


	<h4>FFmpeg library for 32 bit version of Audacity</h4>
	
	<p>To download and install the FFmpeg library:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the website whose address is

		FFmpeg for Audacity folder in either the Program Files (x86) folder on 64-bit Windows,
		or the Program Files folder on 32-bit Windows.</li> 
	</ol>	
	
	<p>Then, the next time Audacity is opened, it automatically finds the
	FFmpeg library.</p>
		
	
	<h3 id="edit-metadata-tags-dialog-opens-during-export">Edit Metadata Tags dialog opens
	during export</h3>
	
	<p>To set whether the Edit Metadata Tags dialog automatically opens each
	time you export audio:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Import/Export
		category.</li>

		<li>In the When exporting tracks to an audio file group, there's
		a Show Metadata tags Editor prior to export check box,
		which is checked by default.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3 id="default-folders">Default folders</h3>

	<p>By default, when you execute one of the commands open, save, import
	or export, and a dialog opens so that you can choose a file, the default
	folder is set to be the last folder which you used for that command. If
	you haven't used the command before, then the default folder is a folder
	named Audacity in your Documents folder, which is automatically created
	by audacity.</p>

	<p>However, for each of these commands, if you don't want the default folder
	to be the last folder, you can set the default folder to always be a
	particular folder. To do this:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Directories category.</li>

		<li>You can then <strong>Tab</strong> to the controls for setting the
		default folders (directories). For each of the commands there is an edit
		box and a Browse button, and by default the edit box is empty.</li>
		
		<li>Although it's possible to type in the full path of a folder into
		one of the edit boxes, it's much easier to press the Browse button following it.
		This opens a Choose a location dialog, where you can select a folder.</li>
	</ol>
	

	<h3 id="use-dialog-for-name-of-a-new-label">Use dialog for the name of a new label</h3>

	<p>The option to use a dialog for the name of a new label is described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#creating-labels">Creating labels section</a> of the Labels section.
	This option is not checked by default, but for users of screen readers, it's
	recommended that it is checked:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Tracks Behaviors category.</li>

		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Use dialog for name of a new label
		check box, and check it.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3 id="type-to-create-a-label">Type to create a label</h3>

	<p>When a label track is the focus, if the Type to create a label
	option is on, then pressing any letter or number automatically creates a new
	label. By default this option is off, and users of screen readers will probably
	want to leave this unchanged. However, if you do want to change this option:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Tracks Behaviors category.</li>
		
		<li>In the Behaviors group, there is a Type to create a label
		check box.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3>Recording options</h3>
	
	<p>A number of recording options can be set in the recording category of the Preferences dialog,
	and these are described in the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#recording-settings">Recording settings section</a> of the
	Recording section.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
	
	<p>The controls in the Keyboard category of Preferences enable you to
	manage the keyboard shortcuts for all the commands available in Audacity.</p>

	<p>As well as the standard way of accessing these controls by opening the preferences
	dialog and selecting the keyboard category, there is an additional method which you
	may find convenient. If you select a command on one of the menus on the
	menu bar, and press <strong>Shift + Enter</strong> rather than the usual <strong>Enter</strong>
	then a dialog opens which has the title Preferences: keyboard. In the tree view or list
	which are described below, the command is already selected. Note that this method
	does not work if the command in the menu is unavailable.</p>
	
	<p>The first three controls in the keyboard category are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A group of radio buttons which controls how the commands and
		associated shortcuts are displayed: View by Tree, Name, and Key.
		These are described in the next three sections.</li>
		
		<li>An edit box, which allow you to search for commands
		and shortcuts, as described in the <a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#searching">Searching section</a>.
		The name of this edit box is Search if the View by setting is Tree or Name,
		and Hotkey if the setting is Key.</li>
		
		<li>A tree view or a list of commands, depending
		on which View by radio button is selected.</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h4>View by tree</h4>
	
	<p>The commands are displayed as a tree view, and if a command has a shortcut
	associated with it, then although this appears before the name of the command,
	screen readers read this after the name of the command.</p>

	<p>The layout of the commands in the tree view mirrors the structure of the menus
	in the menu bar of Audacity's main window. So at the top level of the tree view
	are the names of the menus in the menu bar.
	Each of these names contains the commands in that menu, and the names of any
	sub menus contain the commands in that sub menu.</p>
	
	
	<h4>View by name</h4>
	
	<p>The commands are displayed as a list which is sorted alphabetically
	be the name of the command. If a command has a shortcut assigned to
	it, then although this is displayed before the name of the command,
	screen readers read this after the name of the command.
	Note the if the command appears in a sub menu,
	then the name of the command is prefixed with the name of the sub menu,
	for example Add New - Audio Track. This is so that commands
	which have the same name, but which appear in different sub menus
	can be distinguished from one another.</p>
	
	
	<h4>View by Key</h4>
	
	<p>The commands are displayed using a list of commands, and if the command
	has a shortcut assigned to it, this is displayed before the name of
	the command. The commands with shortcuts are listed first, and these are
	sorted alphabetically by the command's shortcut. The commands without shortcuts
	are then listed alphabetically by the name of the command.
	As in the case of View by name, if a command appears in a sub menu, then the name
	of the command is prefixed with the name of the sub menu.</p>
	
	
	<h4 id="searching">Searching</h4>
	
	<p>You can search for a command or commands using the edit box whose name is
	either Search or Hotkey, depending on the view. The
	search results are shown in the tree view or the list as soon as anything is
	entered in the edit box  you don't have to press enter. The details of
	the search depend on the view:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>View by Tree. The text you enter is matched against both the names of
		the commands and any assigned shortcut.</li>
		
		<li>View by Name. The text you enter is matched against only the names of the
		commands.</li>
		
		<li>View by Key. The key or key combination you press is matched only against
		the shortcuts.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Changing a shortcut</h4>
	
	<p>To set a shortcut:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the tree view or list, select the command whose shortcut you
		want to change.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the short cut edit box,
		and press a key or key combination for the shortcut.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Set button, and press it. If the shortcut
		is already assigned to another command, then an Error dialog opens which
		tells you the name of this command. If you press the OK button, then
		the shortcut will be set a requested, and removed from the other command.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>To clear a shortcut:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Tree view or list, select the command whose shortcut
		you want to clear.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Clear button, and press it.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3 id="standard-and-full">Standard and full sets of default shortcuts</h3>
	
	<p>There are two sets of default shortcuts:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The full set includes all the shortcuts which were default shortcuts present in
		Audacity 2.1.3, and this guide assumes you are using the full set.</li>
		
		<li>The standard set, which was new in Audacity 2.2.0. This contains fewer shortcuts
		than the full set, the idea being to make it easier for people to set their
		own shortcuts, since there are fewer shortcuts that have already been assigned.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If Audacity 2.2.0 or later is run in a user account where versions of Audacity
	before 2.2.0 have not been run, then Audacity uses the standard set of shortcuts.
	However if one of these older versions has been run, then the full set if used,
	and there is no need to change which set of default shortcuts is being used.</p>
	
	<p>To reset all the shortcuts to either the standard or full set of defaults:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Keyboard category.</li>
		
		<li>Tab to the Defaults button and press it. A menu opens.</li>
		
		<li>Choose Standard or Full</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="the-and-shortcuts">The left and right bracket shortcuts on keyboards
	other than US, UK or Irish</h3>

	<p>By default, the keyboard shortcuts for moving the cursor to the playback position
	and setting the end of the selection to be the playback position are the
	left and right bracket keys. These keystrokes can also be used to open dialog boxes
	when there is no playback.</p>

	<p>On US, UK, and Irish keyboards, the left and right bracket keys are the
	two keys to the right of the letter P key. On nearly all the keyboards
	used in other countries, the keys used to type Left Bracket and Right Bracket,
	are in different positions, and you often have to use modifier keys, such as
	<strong>Ctrl + Alt</strong> to type these characters. Unfortunately, using Audacity's
	default settings, the Left and Right bracket keys only execute the commands
	described above when these keys are to the right of the letter P key.</p>

	<p>However, there is a straightforward solution to this problem. All you
	need to do is set the keyboard shortcuts for the two commands using the
	method described in the previous section. The letters G and H are currently
	not used as the shortcuts for any commands, so a suitable option is to set the shortcut for
	the Left at Playback Position command to be the letter G, and the shortcut
	for the Right at Playback Position command to be the letter H.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="automatic-checking-for-updates">Automatic checking for updates</h3>

	<p>By default Audacity now periodically checks to see whether there
	is a new version are available. When one is available, a dialog opens
	with this information, and there is the option to install the update. If
	you press the install button in this dialog, it will start a download
	of the installer for the new version, but won't actually run the installer.
	If you don't want this automatic checking to happen, then in the Preferences
	dialog, in the Application category, there's a Check for updates
	check box. By default it's checked.</p>
	
	
	<h2 id="sound-dialog-in-windows">Sound dialog in Windows</h2>
	
	<p>The Windows Sound dialog in Windows 7 and later versions has four pages:
	Playback, Recording, Sounds, and Communications.
	The following sections describe how to open this
	dialog, the controls on the Recording page, and how to open
	a device's properties dialog where you can adjust the input
	level of the device.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Opening the Sound dialog</h3>
	
	<p>Here are a couple of ways of opening the dialog, and this is the first:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press the <strong>Windows Key</strong>. The start menu opens.</li>
		
		<li>Type system sounds, then if necessary press <strong>Down Arrow</strong> until you get
		to Change system sounds in the list of search results, and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.
		The Sound dialog opens on the Sounds page.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>And this is the second way:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Press the <strong>Windows Key</strong>. The start menu opens.</li>

		<li>Type mmsys.cpl, and this should be the first search result. Press <strong>Enter</strong>.
		The Sound dialog opens on the Playback page.</li>
	</ol>
		
	
	<h3>Recording page</h3>
	
	<p>The recording page contains a list of devices, and when appropriate,
	one or more of the buttons: Configure, Set Default, and Properties.
	The commands provided by the buttons are also available on the
	context menus of the devices in the list, and it's normally easier
	to use these, rather than the buttons.</p>
	
	<p>There are two options which control which devices appear on the
	list, and they appear on the context menu of any of the items in
	the list. The two options are Show Disabled Devices and Show
	Disconnected Devices.
	If you can't find a device which you think should be there, it
	may be disabled, and so will only show up if the Show Disabled Devices
	option is checked.</p>
	
	<p>For each item on the list there are three lines of text: its
	name, a short description, and its status, such as working,
	disabled, or Not plugged in. NVDA automatically reads all three
	lines of text, but Jaws and Narrator only read the first
	line. If you're using Jaws, you can read the other two lines
	using the Jaws cursor. In addition, if you open the item's context
	menu, there will be either an enable or a disable command,
	which tells you whether or not the item is disabled or enabled,
	respectively.</p>

	
	<h3>Device properties dialog</h3>
	
	<p>To open the Properties dialog of a device which is selected in
	list on the Recording page, press
	<strong>Spacebar</strong>, or choose Properties from its context
	menu.</p>
	
	<p>The input volume (level) can be set on the Levels page of
	this dialog. For many devices there's a single slider, but
	a microphone may also have a microphone boost slider.</p>	
	

	<h2 id="keystrokes">Keystrokes</h2>
	
	<p>These are the keystrokes for the full set of default keystrokes
	 some of these are not included in the standard set. For more information about
	these two sets of defaults and how to change which set you are using,
	see the
	<a href="https://vip.chowo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaws/Audacity-3.0.3-Guide.html#standard-and-full">Standard and full sets of default shortcuts section</a>,
	in the Preferences section.</p>
